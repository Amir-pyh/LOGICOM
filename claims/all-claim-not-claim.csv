It depends. For students interested in languages, or have had some study and are contemplating careers that require - or at least would benefit from - language study and cultural knowledge: Yes, college-level study should be mandatory for all four years.
But I don't think it's right for every student. Learning another language takes time and dedication; it's hard and if you don't want to do it, you're probably not going to. Therefore, students who aren't interested, don't see it as relevant or aren't good at it will probably view the required classes as a waste of time. They should not be forced into it. They would benefit more from classes focused on their interests and major in order to get a job.
In any case, four years of college-level study is hardly enough time to master a foreign language, even with study abroad programs and language housing. Proficiency is a lifelong endeavor that cannot be reduced to a few classes. Therefore, rather than making foreign language study mandatory in college, it should be so starting in kindergarten all the way through high school, with the option for further study as a personal choice in college. After all, our best years to learn a language are our earliest. If learning a foreign language was mandatory beginning in kindergarten, the door would open to language proficiency and cross-cultural understanding on a much greater level across the U.S. Yet it would give each college student the choice to walk in and embrace foreign language or close the door and focus on other studies.
I love learning languages and wish everyone felt the same. It helps me understand other people through their lens, not just my own. It is also more than words; it's about communicating across a divide to help you understand where another person is coming from. So do I wish it were mandatory? Yes, but it's not realistic."

2,10527395_0_A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ,it is almost never carried out properly,it is almost always carried out properly,1,Nuclear energy can be safer and cleaner if carried out properly.,Nuclear power is the answer to climate change,Is Nuclear Power the Answer?,A group of climate scientists want environmentalists to see nuclear power as a way to combat climate change. Are they on to something?,"Ken Caldeira, Kerry Emanuel, James Hansen and Tom Wigley have done extraordinary work to document and understand climate change, so it's significant that they are trying to jump-start a serious discussion of solutions. But like many distinguished scientists and engineers before them, they are overstating the promises of nuclear power, understating the risks and dismissing opposition as emotional and biased.
After 50 years of effort, hundreds of billions of dollars in research, direct and indirect subsidies and a history of political support at the highest levels, the U.S. has only managed to generate 20 percent of its electricity through nuclear generation. Could we dramatically expand nuclear power in the U.S.? Perhaps, but the tragic events at Fukushima make it clear that we should not expand in seismically active zones, which rules out most of the west coast and some of the mid-continent. Neither should we expand nuclear power near heavily populated cities, which rules out much of the northeast and mid-Atlantic corridor. Nuclear power requires access to large volumes of water, which rules out much of the southwest.
So we are left with the southeast, and parts of the midwest. Public acceptance of nuclear power is fairly high in some parts of these regions, and some plants have licenses for expanded capacity. But we'd still have to deal with the waste, something we've not yet been able to do.
And that's the point: nuclear power has never delivered on its promises. It hasn't been the miracle technology that its advocates envisioned back in the 1950s, and it remains one of our most expensive sources of electricity. Citizen opposition explains very little of its high cost, most of which arose from difficulties inherent to the technology and its management.
Several commentators, myself included, have argued for a new Manhattan Project on energy and the environment to develop options. This could include safer reactors, but also carbon capture and sequestration, improved efficiency and storage for renewable sources, better building design, and smart electricity grids, as well as regulatory and taxation structures that foster innovation and public acceptance.
The Manhattan Project was only trying to do one thing - build a deliverable nuclear weapon to use in World War II - and there were several ideas on the table as to how to do it. The approach taken was not to decide in advance which technological approach was most likely to succeed, but to try them all. It was an expensive strategy, but it worked. This is what we need to do now.
Like all analogies, this one has its limits. The Manhattan project was formulated in the absence of a scientific bureaucracy; a new Manhattan Project faces the risk that funds would be channeled into ""research as usual."" For security reasons, the Manhattan Project was highly concentrated; a new project would require diverse elements placed where expertise was greatest. The president should appoint a commission, comprised of business and academic leaders not currently invested (either financially or intellectually) in existing projects and programs, to develop a blueprint.
One last thought. The scientists' argument is founded on the presumption that energy supply ""must continue to grow."" But per capita electricity use in California has been nearly flat since the 1970s, so economic growth does not have to be tied to energy growth. It is also built on the presumption that emotions are an illegitimate basis for decision-making. Yet, emotions are as real as the technologies they respond to, and until we have a better understanding of people's feelings about a proposed solution, until scientists and engineers begin to take seriously the social dimensions of technology, we are unlikely to achieve what we all agree is urgently needed."

Firms have failed, they are hiring fewer entry-level lawyers and, as a result, student demand for legal education has plummeted. According to the Law School Admissions Council, the organization that administers the LSAT, the number of students taking the exams was at an all-time high during the 2009-2010 academic year - 171,514 - and dropped to 101,689 in 2014-2015. The 205 American Bar Association-approved law schools are now competing for the best students in this shrunken pool.
Schools have responded variously to this new landscape. The most highly ranked (and well endowed) schools have not changed much, but others have downsized to retain their selectivity, or maintained their size by admitting students with less selective profiles, or sought to become more attractive by offering accelerated two-year programs. Though the pool has changed, we shouldn't make broad generalizations about the quality of today's law students or future lawyers based on a changing market for legal education.
Still, according to the National Conference of Bar Examiners, there was a drop in bar passage rates in 38 states in 2013 and 2014. And 2015 statistics look likely to mark a third year of decline. Some say the bar results reflect a change in the quality of law school candidates as measured by LSAT scores. But embedded in those statistics are schools whose student profiles vary but whose bar passage rates are virtually identical. For example, in 2015, 89 percent of the graduates of Florida International University Law School - ranked 102 by U.S. News and World Report - passed the bar compared to 87 percent of the graduates of 47th ranked University of Florida. And despite the aggregate bar passage slip, the reality is that the bulk of accredited law schools produce excellent graduates who pass their bar exams and go on to meet the legal and leadership needs of their communities.
Nonetheless, law schools have a duty to examine the circumstances that may prevent some students from passing the bar, whether rooted in student capacity or pedagogical weakness, and act swiftly to address them. That action could include early identification of students who may have difficulty on exams or courses to ensure students are familiar with the content of bar exams and have exposure to specific test-taking skills necessary to pass them. After all, the American Bar Association obliges its law schools to maintain ""a rigorous program of legal education that prepares its students...for admission to the bar."" There is also an ethical obligation we owe students in light of the tremendous debt they assume and the sacrifices they make to enter the legal profession.
It is imperative, however, that law schools not overreact to the bar exam decline by limiting access to legal education.

Many professors have wondered (based on some damning evidence) how strong a role gender bias plays in evaluations.
Since Rate My Professors is the only place that puts large numbers of evaluations in the public eye, it offers a unique chance to see how language is used to describe male and female professors differently. I downloaded most of the reviews from the site in 2014 -- about 14 million of them -- and made an interactive website (which you can explore here) to pinpoint precisely how often different words are used to describe men and women. (I statistically guessed at gender using lists of first names from the Social Security Administration). Many users of my site expect sexism to take the form of objectification. But while Rate My Professors (and its infamous chili peppers) do promote a lot of verbiage about teachers' looks, students are just about as likely to call men ""hot"" or ""sexy"" as they are women.
The most striking differences, instead, lie in the criteria on which men and women seem to be judged. Words that are opposites of each other frequently show the same gender skew. For instance, although men are more likely referred to as ""smart,"" ""stupid"" is about even; and a man is strikingly more likely to be an""idiot"" than is a woman. Men are more likely to be criticized as ""arrogant,"" but also more frequently praised for being ""humble""; they're often ""cool,"" except when they're ""weird."" Women, on the other hand, are more often praised or criticized for being ""organized"" or ""disorganized,"" ""helpful"" or ""unhelpful,"" or ""friendly"" or ""unfriendly.""
Unfortunately, these different regimes aren't simply alternate ways of being a great teacher. An ""absentminded"" professor is more readily excused than a ""stupid"" one. Men are 40 percent more likely to be ""smart"", but 70 percent more likely to be ""brilliant"" and 130 percent more like to be a ""genius."" The things women are judged on, on the other hand, may take more work for less reward. Perhaps it's no surprise that women score about a tenth of a point lower on the site both for ""helpfulness"" and ""clarity"" (adjusted for field).

Many professors have wondered (based on some damning evidence) how strong a role gender bias plays in evaluations.
Since Rate My Professors is the only place that puts large numbers of evaluations in the public eye, it offers a unique chance to see how language is used to describe male and female professors differently. I downloaded most of the reviews from the site in 2014 -- about 14 million of them -- and made an interactive website (which you can explore here) to pinpoint precisely how often different words are used to describe men and women. (I statistically guessed at gender using lists of first names from the Social Security Administration). Many users of my site expect sexism to take the form of objectification. But while Rate My Professors (and its infamous chili peppers) do promote a lot of verbiage about teachers' looks, students are just about as likely to call men ""hot"" or ""sexy"" as they are women.
The most striking differences, instead, lie in the criteria on which men and women seem to be judged. Words that are opposites of each other frequently show the same gender skew. For instance, although men are more likely referred to as ""smart,"" ""stupid"" is about even; and a man is strikingly more likely to be an""idiot"" than is a woman. Men are more likely to be criticized as ""arrogant,"" but also more frequently praised for being ""humble""; they're often ""cool,"" except when they're ""weird."" Women, on the other hand, are more often praised or criticized for being ""organized"" or ""disorganized,"" ""helpful"" or ""unhelpful,"" or ""friendly"" or ""unfriendly.""
Unfortunately, these different regimes aren't simply alternate ways of being a great teacher. An ""absentminded"" professor is more readily excused than a ""stupid"" one. Men are 40 percent more likely to be ""smart"", but 70 percent more likely to be ""brilliant"" and 130 percent more like to be a ""genius."" The things women are judged on, on the other hand, may take more work for less reward. Perhaps it's no surprise that women score about a tenth of a point lower on the site both for ""helpfulness"" and ""clarity"" (adjusted for field).
Are these issues unique to Rate My Professors? It's unlikely. More formal evaluations (even outside colleges and universities) probably show many of the same biases. All of these ratings should be treated with healthy skepticism."

Moscow has never seriously pushed the Assad regime to compromise with the opposition. Instead it has delivered weapons and shielded the regime from international pressure. Now it is increasing its support, trying to turn the anti-ISIS coalition into a pro-Assad coalition.

In legal brothels, employees report that they feel safe, are free to come and go, and are bound only by their contract. Of the brothel workers we surveyed, 84 per cent said that their job felt safe. Workers report that they felt safe largely because the police, employers and co-workers were there to protect them.
Our research found that women came to the legal brothels from a wide variety of situations. Some were supplementing low paying service jobs. Some were escaping the hustle and danger illegal sex work. Some were looking for ways to supplement their erotic dancing or film careers.
Some had pimps. Most did not. One woman told us the brothel allowed her to sever ties with an abusive pimp. Most important, in all our research, we found no evidence of trafficking in the legal brothels.
There is certainly room for improvement, particularly in enforcing differences between independent contractors and employees. Women flock to the brothels with the best working conditions, putting pressure on more exploitative managers. Just like in any job, workers with more education and resources were better able to protect their rights.
With concern growing about sex trafficking, the conclusions of our research are striking. Nevada's model is worth considering, but there are plenty of models of legal prostitution throughout the world to draw from, and lots of research on these systems.

Radicalization is a complex phenomenon for which there is no single pathway. Many people are coming from different areas and backgrounds, an with different reasons for committing terrorism and violence.
In my time in the United Kingdom, I have met refugees from places like Syria and Afghanistan, and all of them show signs of love and compassion, and are caring people who are fleeing persecution from groups like ISIS and the Taliban. They make a huge contribution to society. These are people who have lost everything from their homes, belongings, family members and relatives.

Indeed, when you see images of children like 2-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who was trying to make that dream a reality, but was swept aside and drowned alongside his mother, we need to ask tough questions about the response from Europe as regards helping refugees. These are innocent people fleeing the same militants who are targeting Europe and those in Syria. In the same way we should stop blaming religion and Muslims for all the evils that groups like ISIS are perpetuating. As a British-born Muslim, my faith makes it clear that killing anyone is the same as killing all of humanity.

Yet the last four wars the U.S. has fought in the region - in Afghanistan, in the two wars in Iraq and in the current war with ISIS-have resulted in either removing or containing Iran's powerful adversaries. In all these cases, Iran has fanned the flames of war - by encouraging anti-Americanism in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and by encouraging Shiite sectarians in Syria and Iraq - but also worked on the same side with the U.S. The fight against ISIS is the most notable example.
In spite of these confluences of interests, in Tehran and in Washington, there are those who refuse to see the possibility of common interests between the two countries. Anti-American comments by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as he was ostensibly showing support for the nuclear deal, the conservatives' effort to virtually ban all reformist candidates from running in the upcoming election, the Revolutionary Guards' effort to humiliate arrested U.S. sailors are only last week's examples of the potential threats of this intransigent proclivity. And yet, there is also another Iran.
Most Iranians prefer normalized relations with the U.S. In everything from the ethics of everyday life and sartorial style, to what they watch or listen to and how they fashion their families, a majority of Iranians live lives and have political preferences different from the professed pieties and the anti-Americanism of the conservatives. For instance, while the regime keeps offering motherhood and large families as the model of an ideal woman, today more than half of college graduates in Iran are women. These women are poets, publishers, entrepreneurs, bus drivers, actors. There is also a sexual revolution going on in Iran where young men and women are finding increasingly creative ways to meet and establish relations in spite of the regime's policy of gender apartheid.
Furthermore, polls conducted inside Iran indicate that more than three-fourths of the entire population supported the nuclear deal, and favored normalized relations with the U.S. In the last presidential elections, virtually all candidates - even those supported by the most conservative factions - ran on a platform of changing the status quo. The winner, Hassan Rouhani, was the one who most clearly, unabashedly promoted new pragmatic inclusive politics.
What the people of Iran are trying to do - and there is no guarantee they will succeed - is change the regime without violence. They are realizing that politics is not just about who rules at the top, but who shapes everyday life. They have carved out increasingly larger spaces where Big Brother has no right to intrude. Assessing the threat from Iran must combine understanding the power of the conservatives and the potential of those trying to temper the regime.
Iran's prosperous diaspora must also be part of any equation assessing the extent of the Iranian threat. And they are increasingly articulate in advocating pragmatism in Iran. Community-based organizations, groups dedicated to explicating the complexities of Iranian society or facilitating citizen diplomacy, academic centers dedicated to the study of modern Iran are parts of this new diaspora activism.
Of course, it is still folly to underestimate the continued shenanigans of Iran's conservative cabal, but it would be an even bigger mistake to overlook the power and potential of the ascending forces of change in the country."

Classes were large, salaries were low, and working conditions were poor. Supervisors and school boards, male-dominated, made many rules governing teachers' lives. In some cities, for example, school boards fired teachers if they married, or if they were allowed to marry, they were fired if they became pregnant.
In the early days of the formation of teachers' unions, teachers cared most about two issues: tenure and pensions. Teachers wanted some guarantee that they would not retire to a life of poverty. And they wanted assurance that they could not be fired for arbitrary and capricious reasons. They wanted to be sure that they could not be fired by a school board that wanted to hire a colleague's daughter or sister, or fired by a principal who didn't like their looks or their religion.
The Vergara decision in California strikes at one of the issues that matters most to teachers today. Unlike tenure in higher education, public school tenure is not a guarantee of a lifetime job. In elementary and secondary education, tenure is a guarantee that a teacher can be fired only for just cause, with due process.
In states with tenure, teachers must work satisfactorily for a period of time before they are eligible for tenure. In California, it was 18 months -- or two school years. In most other states, it is three or four years. Only then may the principal decide whether to grant tenure. A teacher with tenure is entitled to a hearing before he or she may be fired, and evidence of misconduct must be presented before an independent hearing officer.
Tenure protects academic freedom. In the absence of tenure, teachers may be fired for any reason. Teachers may be fired if the principal doesn't like them or if they are experienced and become too expensive. Teachers may be fired for being outspoken.
There is no evidence that tenure causes low test scores. There is no evidence that children get higher achievement if their teachers have no tenure. The best predictor of low test scores is poverty. Every standardized test -- whether the SAT, the ACT, state tests, national tests, or international tests - shows the effects of family income on test scores.
Schools in poor communities typically experience high teacher turnover because of lack of resources, large classes, and the challenge of teaching the neediest children while being held accountable for their test scores.
The loss of tenure will make it even more difficult to staff schools in the poorest neighborhoods. Abolishing tenure solves no problems for students and creates massive demoralization among teachers, who understand that their job depends now on compliance to administrators, at whose whim they serve.

Yet in some regions population is still growing almost as fast as when Paul Ehrlich first raised his alarm, and with still-frightening consequences.
To be sure, population itself is not necessarily a problem. Some of the richest places on earth, such as the Netherlands and Japan, are among the most densely populated. But risks of violent conflict rise when a surging youth population cannot find productive employment, and when a country lacks the resource cushion and quality of government to respond to intermittent crises.
Today, population growth is most rapid in precisely such places, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
In countries such as Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda, women still have from 5 to 6 children, on average, while in conflict-torn countries such as Yemen, Iraq, and Afghanistan, they are still having an average of 4 children during their lifetimes.
In sub-Saharan Africa fertility rates have remained stubbornly high despite two decades of reasonable income growth and rapid urbanization. The key missing factor seems to be secondary education for women, which only a minority in that region have completed. Women who leave school before age 17 remain vulnerable to early marriage, and are less likely to take advantage of modern contraception, leading to larger families.
Regions with very large youth cohorts are historically far more prone to violence than older populations, and high fertility rates are a formula for maintaining very young populations. Only when fertility falls and investments in each child start to rise do societies appear to get on track for political stability and sustained growth in per capita incomes.

Well, I exaggerate a bit. But it is true that Mencius's mother, a widow, moved three times before she found the right neighborhood - next to a school - to raise her son. The story goes that Mencius was inspired by the scholars he met every day and eventually grew up to be one.
Putting aside the debate about stereotypes - be they about Chinese, women, or other groups - which Amy Chua's essay has plenty, parents everywhere are always looking for tips to help their children thrive. Think Baby Einstein.
Parenting skills are about methods, that is, ""how?"" Equally important, but much less in the limelight, are the ""why"" and ""is that all"" questions. Why do we want our children to be successful? This drive comes not just from the culture, tradition or values; it also comes from everything that surrounds parents and their children - history, economy, society and even geography (I research human geography).
Success is one of the ways for Chinese Americans, and all minorities, to become visible, accepted, and to break the glass ceiling. But it takes more than success, actually. When Sarah Hughes - not Michelle Kwan - won the figure skating gold medal at the 2002 Olympics, a headline on an article in The Seattle Times was ""American outshines Kwan."" Even with success, Asian Americans are often still seen as a different kind of Americans, if not foreigners altogether.
On the other side of the Pacific, where the history is different, parents' desire for their children to succeed is equally strong. Many single children - products of China's one-child policy - are overprotected by their parents who, having lived through the Cultural Revolution and periods of deprivation, would do anything to provide for and educate their children. But over protection breeds dependence. A professor in China recently called me and asked what his 21-year-old son should do to apply to U.S. graduate programs. I replied with a question: ""Why doesn't your son find out by himself or contact me directly?""
Finally, is success all there is to it? I hope not. Success is good, and important (so is money), and behind it we may find intelligence, hard work, discipline, good work ethics, and even passion, confidence and high self-esteem. But success alone does not guarantee kindness, compassion, empathy, tolerance, generosity, a sense of fairness and equity, and a vision of the future, all qualities our next generations - and we, too - need."

Well, I exaggerate a bit. But it is true that Mencius's mother, a widow, moved three times before she found the right neighborhood - next to a school - to raise her son. The story goes that Mencius was inspired by the scholars he met every day and eventually grew up to be one.
Putting aside the debate about stereotypes - be they about Chinese, women, or other groups - which Amy Chua's essay has plenty, parents everywhere are always looking for tips to help their children thrive. Think Baby Einstein.
Parenting skills are about methods, that is, ""how?"" Equally important, but much less in the limelight, are the ""why"" and ""is that all"" questions. Why do we want our children to be successful? This drive comes not just from the culture, tradition or values; it also comes from everything that surrounds parents and their children - history, economy, society and even geography (I research human geography).
Success is one of the ways for Chinese Americans, and all minorities, to become visible, accepted, and to break the glass ceiling. But it takes more than success, actually. When Sarah Hughes - not Michelle Kwan - won the figure skating gold medal at the 2002 Olympics, a headline on an article in The Seattle Times was ""American outshines Kwan."" Even with success, Asian Americans are often still seen as a different kind of Americans, if not foreigners altogether.
On the other side of the Pacific, where the history is different, parents' desire for their children to succeed is equally strong. Many single children - products of China's one-child policy - are overprotected by their parents who, having lived through the Cultural Revolution and periods of deprivation, would do anything to provide for and educate their children. But over protection breeds dependence. A professor in China recently called me and asked what his 21-year-old son should do to apply to U.S. graduate programs. I replied with a question: ""Why doesn't your son find out by himself or contact me directly?""
Finally, is success all there is to it? I hope not. Success is good, and important (so is money), and behind it we may find intelligence, hard work, discipline, good work ethics, and even passion, confidence and high self-esteem. But success alone does not guarantee kindness, compassion, empathy, tolerance, generosity, a sense of fairness and equity, and a vision of the future, all qualities our next generations - and we, too - need."

There is a maximum price that you'd pay for that coffee, based on the quality of the coffee, the convenience of the location, the ambiance in the store, and so forth. There is also a minimum price that the coffee shop will take that covers their expenses. The difference between the maximum price and the actual price you pay is what an economist would call ""consumer surplus."" You would have paid more, but didn't, and so you got some benefit.
A monopoly lowers your consumer surplus because it has market power that determines how close the actual price gets to the maximum price you'll pay. This market power is not necessarily due to having few firms (or even one). It could be that your preferences are inelastic, meaning that you have a fixed demand for a product. If you cannot live without that coffee in the morning, for example, then the coffee shop can charge you something very close to the maximum price you'd pay.
Every firm has some market power. Even the gas station on the corner near my house has a little market power, as I'll go there even if the station across the street is charging a lower price. Why? Because getting across the street would require me to make two left turns, and when I'm on my way home from work, that extra annoyance is not worth the 2 cents a gallon I might save. Part of the market power that your coffee shop has is because of the fact that it is located right on your way to work.
Something like the gas station's or coffee shop's market power is at work with Google, but stronger. Google has market power because leaving Google involves the digital equivalent of six left turns, two lane changes and a stretch of gravel road. The European Union asserts that Android and its search engine give Google a privileged location, which it uses to sell its own app store and other services. This is not much different than how my local gas station or your coffee shop use their unique locations as a form of market power.
But Google's market power is more pervasive because, in contrast to the gas station and the coffee shop, there is no natural limit to its market. Google is in every neighborhood on the Internet. It is the neighborhood, in many respects.
Because of this market power, Google is capable of charging a price for their services close to the maximum price that its customers will bear, limiting consumer surplus. And even though you and I use Google for free, the lack of consumer surplus enjoyed by Google's paying customers -- advertisers, mainly -- means that you and I also ultimately bear a loss of consumer surplus as they need to raise their prices.
But the future loss of consumer surplus due to a lack of competition is perhaps even more costly. With their privileged position, a firm like Google has far less incentive to innovate and improve its body of products. Why waste the money trying to attract new customers when you already have all of them? This doesn't mean that Google won't innovate; it does, and it will. But would Google innovate faster if they felt pressure from a rival capable of peeling off their customers?
A firm with market power may also restrict innovation by other firms. The presence of your coffee shop in a specific location means that another business, which may actually provide more consumer surplus to you, cannot be in that same location. With Google occupying a dominant ""location"" on the Internet, other innovative companies that might have provided even better services cannot occupy that same location."

This is roughly 16 million more than in 2000. Equally troubling, wages have stagnated or declined for most American workers. This is especially true for the least educated, who are most likely to compete with immigrants (legal and illegal).

Instead, it's the world's superwealthiest - many of whom got that way by exploiting the vast economic imbalances that helped cause the 2008 crisis and continue to retard recovery.
If you made your money in a not-quite-ethical way, in a country with no predictable rule of law, it's no mystery why you want to stash a big chunk of it in a condo here. Even losing 20 percent of your investment in a downturn is better than losing all of it to expropriation, and maybe your head, too.
Meanwhile, the zero-percent interest rates that Western governments have maintained since 2008 have pushed stock markets, bond markets, art markets and real-estate markets to record highs - and created such uncertainty about what will happen when rates go up that lots of rich folk feel safe putting their money only in something physical, like a building.
When only multibillionaires can buy on Central Park South, multimillionaires move to other parts of Manhattan, mere millionaires move to Brooklyn, and everyone else - from doctors to home-healthcare aides - struggle to pay the rent. What can the city do?   Lobby Washington to make real-estate investments subject to the same money-laundering and other anti-corruption protections that apply to other types of American investments. All high-end real-estate developers and salespeople should know their end customers - and, like bankers who launder money, be held accountable when those customers turn out to be crooks.

The vast concentration of wealth that is the direct result of those failures is distorting where and how New Yorkers live now.
There's not much New York, by itself, can do to fix this problem. But the city sure can lessen the effect on the city's quality of life - or, at the least, not make the problem worse. New York - under both former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and, now, Mayor Bill de Blasio - has failed on both counts.

The tree fruit industry is labor intensive: multiple tasks need to be performed at orchards by hand to produce high-quality fruit. Not surprisingly, labor accounts for 46 percent of all variable costs for growers (based on Washington-grown Gala apples).
The challenges for growers would begin with a labor shortage. Working in a tree fruit orchard is unappealing for most domestic workers, given the relatively low wages compared with other U.S. jobs, the hard physical labor involved, the harsh weather conditions, and the seasonal employment patterns. Someday, the industry's dependence on labor may be eased by mechanization - but that alternative remains at the research stage and would take several years to be fully ready to implement. Even then, it is very unlikely that growers would be willing to assume substantial increased debt to buy the expensive machinery and to replace productive trees with those suitable to mechanical harvesting.
Regarding consumers, the average American's annual consumption of apples has been declining (in 1980, 19.2 pounds per capita, and in 2008, 16.2 pounds) and shifting to other fruits, for example, berries and imported tropical fruits. If production costs suddenly increased because of labor shortage or higher wages, it is likely that consumers would shift to other affordable types of fruit or to similar and less expensive imported fruit to meet their demand. It is also possible that consumers will simply buy less fresh fruit and opt for a not-so-healthy alternative.
In such a market, it is important for the industry, academia and government to redouble efforts to make high-quality domestically grown fresh fruit more affordable to consumers. Researchers are trying on multiple fronts to address the market challenges, but results will not happen immediately. Note that China, the largest apple producer in the world, dominates the U.S. apple processing market and has been gaining market share in international fresh apple markets. International markets are crucial for U.S. apple growers; 30 percent of Washington-produced apples are exported. Most definitely, sharply higher labor costs in the U.S. will hurt American growers' competitiveness abroad."

Greece's creditors are insisting that it impose severe tax hikes and pension cuts to secure much-needed loans. The level of imposed immiseration behind such policies seems unimaginable in the 21st century. For example, in addition to the call for increased taxes and reduced benefits, there is an insistent demand to further reduce by 200 euros the meager pensions most Greeks receive.
Existing austerity measures in Greece have already left millions in utter precarity while leaving the resources and lifestyles of the financial elite untouched. The unemployment rate in Greece hovers around 27 percent. Throughout Greece, people now inhabit what might be called zones of abandonment, spaces defined by the need to simply survive. These are spaces inhabited by people who lack viable employment, adequate food, health care and sustainable pensions. It is estimated that more than 1.3 million are jobless, while many people sift through garbage cans for food to survive. It gets worse. The decision to stay the course with the euro has to be measured against the hard realities of human suffering as evidence by the fact that suicides are rising in Greece at alarming rates as a result of the economic hardships produced by the imposed austerity measures. For example, a 2014 study found a link between spending cuts and increased suicide rates among Greek men, while a 2013 paper found a similar connection in Spain following the financial crisis.
What these reports make clear is that austerity policies of the financial elite have inflicted misery and suffering on most of the population. By imposing such measures on Greece and other countries, the troika has embarked on financial warfare.
The Greek people have been brought to their knees under the imperatives of an austerity policy that is not only counterproductive but brutally punishing. Abandoning the euro offers the possibility of bringing this brutal austerity project to an end by putting the needs of the Greek people before those of international banks. Staying with the euro and paying off Greece's massive debt means a future in which a predatory financial system inflicts more pain, protracted suffering and hardship for the Greek people.
Dumping the euro at least speaks to the possibility of another choice, one that will be hopefully far more humane than the punishing strictures of the current politics of austerity inextricably tied to an embrace of the euro."

But these are not normal times. The question is whether a Supreme Court justice - in this case, the second woman on the court, a civil rights icon and pioneering feminist -- has an obligation to remain silent when the country is at risk of being ruled by a man who has repeatedly demonstrated that he is a sexist and racist demagogue. The answer must be no.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent critique of Donald Trump has drawn bipartisan jeers. Ginsburg is being pilloried for publicly saying what many other Americans think, likely including some of her colleagues on the Supreme Court.
Still I understand the concern about Ginsburg going public with her views. Perceptions are important for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court -- that's why the justices wear those silly black robes, sit high on a bench, and make everybody stand up when they enter the courtroom. Pretending that they are above the political fray is part of the same bag of tricks.
It is significant that Ginsburg chose to speak out now. She has been on the court during the presidential campaigns of several conservative Republicans, including George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney. She never criticized them. But there is, as even many Republicans have acknowledged, something different about the Donald.
It's not just Trump's misogyny.

But these are not normal times. The question is whether a Supreme Court justice - in this case, the second woman on the court, a civil rights icon and pioneering feminist -- has an obligation to remain silent when the country is at risk of being ruled by a man who has repeatedly demonstrated that he is a sexist and racist demagogue. The answer must be no.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's recent critique of Donald Trump has drawn bipartisan jeers. Ginsburg is being pilloried for publicly saying what many other Americans think, likely including some of her colleagues on the Supreme Court.
Still I understand the concern about Ginsburg going public with her views. Perceptions are important for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court -- that's why the justices wear those silly black robes, sit high on a bench, and make everybody stand up when they enter the courtroom. Pretending that they are above the political fray is part of the same bag of tricks.
It is significant that Ginsburg chose to speak out now. She has been on the court during the presidential campaigns of several conservative Republicans, including George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney. She never criticized them. But there is, as even many Republicans have acknowledged, something different about the Donald.
It's not just Trump's misogyny.

Today, the United States stands at such a crossroad.
The case against aligning with Assad might seem obvious. This is a man who responded to the Arab Awakening by imprisoning, starving, bombing and gassing his own population. If you want to see moral depravity, Twitter is teaming with photos of fresh atrocities against Syrian civilians.
But from a national security perspective, Washington has a greater obligation to defend American civilians, even if that means working alongside the Alawite dictator. The nature of this cooperation could vary from uncoordinated airstrikes to joint operations. But it's time for the Obama administration to pick its poison by prioritizing the safety of American civilians over the moral objection of helping out a leader who massacres his own.
Make no mistake, Assad and ISIS are both evil. But only one of these evil actors is going to strike the homeland. Until this summer, many analysts could claim that ISIS is mainly a regional threat. After all, it was establishing a perverted caliphate in Syria and Iraq, but had never attacked the United States itself.
Today, however, only a fool would argue against that scenario. An important watershed happened on Aug.8, when the United States ramped up its military involvement in Iraq. Since then, ISIS has issued a series of statements indicating its intent to kill Americans anywhere in the world. The savage beheading of the journalist James Foley makes the threat even more credible. Although citizens of the world are overwhelmingly repulsed by such atrocities, they have the opposite effect on already radicalized members of rival terrorist groups, who are quickly defecting to ISIS.
Most of these defections are occurring in Syria, not Iraq. In fact, most ISIS members are fighting in Syria, not inside its neighbor. And yet, because of our moral inhibitions over siding with Assad, U.S. military efforts against ISIS are limited to Iraq.
This strategy makes no sense if our goal is to degrade ISIS, as President Obama has expressed. On Thursday, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged, ""can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no."" Our national security ultimately depends on crushing ISIS not only in Iraq, but also in Syria.
In the past, Assad's forces were reluctant to engage ISIS directly. But the gloves have come off in the last couple of weeks.

Despite consistently high popular support for legalization, Congress has failed to act. After the 2012 elections, reform seemed possible - many conservative leaders, including Paul Ryan, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly were supportive, and the Senate passed an immigration bill with 68 votes in favor. But, many House Republicans were worried about backlash from conservative constituents, and Eric Cantor's primary loss in 2014 effectively ended any hope for congressional action for the foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) - meant as a temporary measure that would spur congressional action toward a more permanent legislative solution - instead spurred state-level reforms.
Many states began providing drivers licenses to DACA recipients and, especially in Democratic-led states, this paved the way for even more pro-integration policies.
California, for example, has passed an array of immigration reform policies - known as the ""California Package"" - that give undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition and child health benefits, in addition to professional and driver's licenses, and low-cost auto insurance. California was once a major battleground for opposition to unauthorized immigrants, but after years of measures that actually help those immigrants, Californians show overwhelming support for them.
Though it is too early to make conclusions about the effects of these laws on workers and households, the state will likely reap many of the economic benefits that would have occurred under federal immigration reform. Indeed, supporters of these measures have included not only immigrant rights organizations, but also police chiefs who believe the reforms will result in safer roads and fewer unlicensed drivers; business groups seeking economic growth and less labor uncertainty; and health advocates pushing for preventative medicine rather than a reliance on emergency care.
In many ways, these measures benefit not only immigrant residents and their mixed-status families, but also bring important benefits to the state in terms of economic growth, public safety and healthier communities. Finally, most of these immigration laws have passed with Republican as well as Democratic support, a kind of pragmatic, bipartisan leadership that the rest of the country could benefit from - a model, if not for Congress, then certainly to the other states."

(Somatropin) was created in 1981 by Genentech, advancements in research have continued a discussion initially made famous by Maurice Raben in 1958.
Raben, an endocrinologist in Boston, successfully treated a 17-year-old male patient suffering from a growth disorder by injecting him with the H.G.H. (extracted from a cadaver) that he lacked.

From an athlete's standpoint, the benefits could have immeasurable effects, as wear and tear take a natural toll and statistical value decelerates. Traveling without much rest during seasons, the body breaks down, which ultimately leads to athletic retirement.

Should it be raised?,"There is no need to raise the rim just to re-emphasize shooting or to make dunking more special. Shooting is already highly emphasized in today's game, and dunking is such a small part of the game that it is still special when it happens.
Basketball today is more skill based than it once was, which means there are many things that are more emphasized than dunking. A player can play countless games without dunking and still be useful on the court.
Raising the rim is not only unnecessary, but also would hurt the game. The excitement of watching big and tall players throw down emphatic dunks would be greatly missed, but the real harm of a higher rim would be that players would have to change their shooting strokes. Everyone who plays basketball has geared every shot to a rim at 10 feet.

Should it be raised?,"There is no need to raise the rim just to re-emphasize shooting or to make dunking more special. Shooting is already highly emphasized in today's game, and dunking is such a small part of the game that it is still special when it happens.
Basketball today is more skill based than it once was, which means there are many things that are more emphasized than dunking. A player can play countless games without dunking and still be useful on the court.
Raising the rim is not only unnecessary, but also would hurt the game. The excitement of watching big and tall players throw down emphatic dunks would be greatly missed, but the real harm of a higher rim would be that players would have to change their shooting strokes. Everyone who plays basketball has geared every shot to a rim at 10 feet.

The challenge in responding to this seemingly simple question about coerced treatment is in the details. Surely not everyone who is addicted to drugs should be committed to treatment. The opposite is also true. Some addicts should be committed to treatment against their will. Not all coercion is commitment and not all commitment has the force of law.
Two good examples of effective coercion that overcome addiction are HOPE Probation and the state-based Physician Health Programs, both of which are enforced by intensive random monitoring and permit no use of alcohol or other drugs. While these two programs share many similar features, they deal with very different populations of serious substance users: one with convicted felons on probation and the other with physicians. Both are voluntary in the sense that individuals can choose to not abide by the program requirements, but in both cases the consequences may be serious. For probationers in HOPE, the risk of failing is prison and for physicians in P.H.P., it is the loss of a medical license. Both programs produce excellent outcomes for most participants.
Families faced with addiction often reluctantly, and only after many failures, use ""tough love"" to promote treatment and recovery while insisting that their addicted loved ones be drug-free. Families usually have to use a significant measure of coercion not only to get addicts into treatment but also to keep them there and to prevent relapse upon discharge.
As a psychiatrist specializing in the treatment of addiction, I am struck by the stark contrast between addicted people who are using alcohol and other drugs actively and those who are in stable recovery. In the process of recovery there is a transition from near-universal denial of problems and rejection of treatment to gratitude for and acceptance of the coercion that got them on that path. The addict's will is different when using drugs and when in recovery.

Is the diet good for everyone?,"""What are humans really supposed to eat?"" Since our food choices are wrapped up in emotion, fond memories and tradition, this can get a little tricky. Suppose we stripped ourselves of these human issues, looked at ourselves in the mirror, and only saw our bodies.
As members of the animal kingdom, we come equipped with all the tools necessary for obtaining the food that our bodies need and extracting the nutrients. The grizzly bear - an omnivore - is fast and strong-jawed, with razor sharp teeth and claws, and is capable of chasing down a deer, tearing through its flesh, and easily digesting the raw musculature without marination, tenderizing or any cooking at all. It's born with all of the tools, right down to its digestive system, needed to gather and extract the proper nourishment from poor Mr. Deer. The grizzly bear is also capable of extracting nutrients from vegetation and insects.
So are we meant to consume animal products? Is it optimal for our longevity? I think not. Humans are thought to be omnivores - just like the grizzly. Look in that mirror ... we're so much alike, aren't we? I'll tell you what: you show me the guy who can chase down a deer on foot, kill it with his bare hands, tear through its flesh with his own teeth, and digest the raw innards every day without getting ill (and not ""ill"" in the good, 80's rap song way), and I will reconsider my stance.
Can humans digest and extract nutrients from animal products? With processing, yes. Can we be relatively healthy while eating a diet including animal products? Sure. But, based on the logic of the animal kingdom, we are designed to eat plants. Our teeth are dull, our jaws are weak, and eating raw animal flesh usually makes us sick. The tools we are born with lend themselves to obtaining and digesting food that doesn't increase cholesterol, have unnecessary fats, or try to run away or bite us back. I know, it makes us sound like the wusses of the animal kingdom. Maybe that's why we're so enamored with eating other animals - it makes us feel like the Grand Poobah of the planet.
But for those of us who conquer our Poobah complexes: does this mean we should we all go vegan? There are always exceptions, of course. People with extreme allergies, intolerances and genetic deficiencies should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and should, by no means, be used as examples in this debate. That said, the average person not only survives, but thrives on a vegan diet - if they do it right. The way we have been brought up to eat is not conducive to becoming vegan. We can't just throw away all of our hamburgers, replace them with frozen veggie burgers, and expect to have optimal health. The lettuce and tomato must be elevated from topping to main course. We must rethink and relearn the portrait of the plate.
I'm not going to lie, transitioning to a vegan diet is work. Not because it's unnatural, but because we've been taught differently our entire lives. Old habits are hard to break.

This would be a rare occurrence in the US because passions tend to dominate the debate, with ideologically driven pro-bikers shouting over indignant and inconvenienced drivers, commercial haulers and small neighborhood businesses that lose entire segments of their market because of bike lane restrictions.
The hard, cold December reality of bike lanes in U.S. cities is that they will inevitably be a small part, even tiny part in most cases, of America's solution to congestion and mobility. Bike networks represent concentrated, subsidized benefits for a small portion of the commuting public.
Oddly enough, New York City officials don't have a ready numbers on bike commuting mode share. Instead, they rely on overall counts (see the press release from the New York Department of Transportation here), a misleading statistic since the investment in bike lanes is based in large part on the belief that an expanded network will shift significant shares of commuters out of their cars (and perhaps even buses) to relieve congestion, reduce air pollution, and lower carbon dioxide emissions. That doesn't appear to be happening in New York.
In this respect, New York City is more typical of what we can expect in the rest of the nation. Despite adding 400 miles of dedicated bike lanes, the response from most New York commuters has been tepid at best. A small fraction of commuters or travelers who already use public transit or drive switch to biking, and many of the existing bike commuters still prefer the non-striped routes and avenues. Regular bike commuters are a hardy bunch, and those committed few have often already overcome the psychological and practical hurdles necessary to integrate their preferred transportation mode into their lifestyle.
All this is not to say that dedicated bike lanes are a complete waste of time and resources. Rather, it suggests that programs need to be strategically focused and recognize bike travel for the seasonally limited, commuting niche it is rather than a broad-based travel alternative advocates want it to be. These programs also need to be rigorously evaluated to make sure their intended benefits materialize with measurable benchmarks to monitor progress.
Getting bike acceptance levels up to those of models like Amsterdam and Copenhagen takes more than striping lanes. It takes a focused anti-car policy that dramatically increases the costs of using automobiles. At this point, New York City's experiment appears to demonstrate more the objective limits of a pro-bike strategy than a ringing endorsement of a major shift in urban transportation policy."

Our oldest dream story, inscribed in cuneiform millennia ago, tells of the Sumerian shepherd king Dumuzi. He sees his sheepfold abandoned, his shepherd's staff disappears, his sacred cup falls off its peg. This vision of destruction so terrifies him, he runs to his sister, Geshtin-anna, the first dream interpreter, for solace. But she is an honest therapist. She does not dismiss the reality of his dream, but tells him to face its truth.
Genesis, our primordial dream book in the West, also begins with a nightmare. The first time the word ""dream"" appears is when God visits the petty king Abimelech in a dream and tells him, ""You are a dead man.""

Science tells us we dream every night, which suggests that dreaming is a very natural experience. But the question under discussion really is, what are dreams for? If they have no real use, then why not change them? In the ancient view dreams take us to the deepest knowledge of ourselves. In learning to work with dreams from my colleagues at North of Eden, I've found that their difficult trail can move us through our fear and pain to an experience of our own essence.
That use of dreams is not prevalent today, for the world teaches us to be terrified of our vulnerability, to seek control and power in every sphere, and avoid all pain. From that point of view, why not extend our control even into our sleep and rewrite our painful dreams in a general program of nightmare eradication?
But the basic intuition of the ancient world is that dreams can awaken us to a deeper sense of ourselves. The literary prototype for all such dreams is Jacob's dream of the ladder. He wakes in awe, which is a feeling for the sacred. But such transcendent awe has roots in the feelings all our nightmares lead us to, the feelings of fear and pain. Such dream feelings are incredibly intense, and we may need the support of a guide or therapist to face them. But if instead, we try to control or even eliminate the feelings in our dreams, we risk choking off an ancient and natural resource of our inner world."

In learning to work with dreams from my colleagues at North of Eden, I've found that their difficult trail can move us through our fear and pain to an experience of our own essence.
That use of dreams is not prevalent today, for the world teaches us to be terrified of our vulnerability, to seek control and power in every sphere, and avoid all pain. From that point of view, why not extend our control even into our sleep and rewrite our painful dreams in a general program of nightmare eradication?
But the basic intuition of the ancient world is that dreams can awaken us to a deeper sense of ourselves. The literary prototype for all such dreams is Jacob's dream of the ladder. He wakes in awe, which is a feeling for the sacred. But such transcendent awe has roots in the feelings all our nightmares lead us to, the feelings of fear and pain. Such dream feelings are incredibly intense, and we may need the support of a guide or therapist to face them. But if instead, we try to control or even eliminate the feelings in our dreams, we risk choking off an ancient and natural resource of our inner world."

Noncompetes protect the legitimate business interests of employers - usually in the form of trade secrets, confidential information or client relationships - but their enforcement must be balanced against the rights of former employees and the public.
Reasonable enforcement depends entirely on context. For example, it might be reasonable to restrain a well-compensated chief technology officer from immediately taking a similar position with a direct competitor.
Likewise, it may be reasonable for a company to want to prevent former sales employees from poaching certain customers, especially in cases where the employees fostered those relationships at the employer's expense. But it can be unfair when overzealous employers attempt to impose overly broad noncompetes, beyond their legitimate purpose, on employees who pose no actual threat.
To prevent these kinds of situations, and to advance employee mobility, a few states like California have taken the extreme approach of enacting laws that ban noncompetes.

To qualify, one has to show one existing photo ID - such as a driver's license or passport - and proof of residency - such as a lease or utility bill with your name listed and pay $10.

Some protested our action - ""Let 'em get a driver's license"" we heard. But not everyone has a driver's license; Princeton has the highest percentage of residents who walk to work in New Jersey.

Some protested our action - ""Let 'em get a driver's license"" we heard. But not everyone has a driver's license; Princeton has the highest percentage of residents who walk to work in New Jersey.
The program is almost four years old now, we have had no problems of any consequence, other than less overall participation than we would have liked. Government ID cards of any sort have traditionally been a tough sell in America."

Active dual citizenship, on the other hand, means acknowledging or applying such a status by, for instance, voting in a foreign election or registering with the foreign government as a citizen. Such actions used to be called ""expatriating acts"" - engaging in them meant you renounced your U.S. citizenship. The Supreme Court in the 1960s ruled that such acts can no longer automatically lead to the loss of citizenship. But they can still be prohibited by law, as Chief Justice Earl Warren himself wrote.

What good would it do?
Total per-student aid has already more than tripled since 1980, adjusting for inflation. This hasn't made college more affordable, it's just allowed colleges to raise their fees. Student debt, now roughly $1 trillion, is at an all-time high.
The increased aid hasn't done much for the completion rate, either. Barely half of students at four-year public institutions graduate in six years - and many learn very little along the way. Nearly half of all college students made no significant gains in critical thinking, complex reasoning, or written communication after two full years of study, according to research by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa. Even among the more elite subset of students who stick around for four full years of college, a third made no significant gains in these areas.
It's true that college degrees boost income, on average, although the boost is smaller than often imagined. But average benefits don't tell us whether an additional infusion of federal spending would help students. The average includes both academic all-stars who obtain degrees in high-demand fields and weak students pursuing degrees of little labor market value. The former earn huge premiums from their college degrees, the latter, even in the unlikely event they graduate, generally don't.
So the dramatic rise in student aid of the last three decades induced many academically weak students to shoulder huge debts pursuing degrees that taught them next to nothing, which they often failed to complete, and which were of doubtful value even when they did. It makes no sense to perpetuate that policy - particularly now that college-level courses and materials are springing up all over the Web, available at little cost whenever and wherever the motivated student wants.
Can a case be made that the tax exempt status of some non-profit colleges has become an inefficient way to advance higher education? Perhaps. But since increased tax rates usually lead people to report less income, it is likely that taxing endowment earnings would lead colleges to report less of them. So the new revenue generated would pale... in comparison to existing federal student aid. In any event, increasing the current inefficient and even harmful federal college subsidies would hardly be an improvement."

The painful and inconvenient truth is that any rapid reduction in the number of obese Americans would require the private sector to discriminate against, rather than in favor of, the obese.
Instead of expensive lawsuits, counterproductive fat taxes and endless lists of (ignored) nutritional information, we should allow employers, insurers and other institutions to act toward the obese as they see fit.
The thinner path was first mapped out in 2002, when Southwest Airlines initiated a policy of requesting that its largest passengers -- those who require two seats on an airplane -- purchase two tickets. This was a common sense solution to a growing problem, one that was achieved without government interference or fiat. However, today many states are preventing private health insurers from charging overweight and obese clients higher premiums, which effectively removes any financial incentive for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Why is employer-driven discrimination the correct approach? First, this policy would place the costs for being overweight squarely on individuals, giving them stronger incentives to slim down. Second, since most employers want a healthy workforce, it would give them an incentive to help employees control their weight, perhaps by restricting what is served in the company cafeteria, or offering exercise facilities.
Such marketplace-driven discrimination is clearly within the rights of private sector employers. If it turns out that such discrimination actually, if mistakenly, punishes otherwise productive and healthy employees, the marketplace will punish the discriminating company. Morale among overweight employees will plummet and competing firms will reap the economic benefit of retaining, hiring and indulging the obese, especially if consumers are also morally offended and choose to vote with their wallets against such discriminatory practices.
The decision to discriminate -- or not -- is a decision for each individual employer to make according to his or her own economic calculation and moral judgment. Critically, the employer should exclusively bear and enjoy the respective costs and benefits of that private decision."

In the United States today, home birth is a choice women are already making in increasing numbers. The real question we need to answer, so women have evidence-based information to make decisions with, is: What conditions make home birth a safe option?
Studies of large numbers of women who planned home births show which pregnancy-specific conditions are best managed in a hospital. A few examples include evidence of fetal growth restriction, breech presentation, multiples (i.e. twins) and premature labor. Women who have significant psychiatric conditions, substance abuse problems or certain chronic illnesses could also have a difficult labor, perhaps best managed in a hospital setting.
But, the question of safety also implicitly asks ""How often do emergencies occur?"" and ""How likely is it that the mother or baby will die?"" In fact, the majority of labor and birth complications are non-emergencies. There is usually time for the woman or infant to be transferred to a hospital and cared for safely. Life-threatening emergencies that are not predictable are extremely rare - although they do occur both at home and in the hospital at roughly equal rates.
In Britain, the national health service actually advises healthy women that it is safer to have children at home, or in a birth center, rather than a hospital, when the pregnancy is low-risk.
Still, in the U.S., the home birth process could be improved with more advanced, integrated systems to streamline transfers into hospitals when complications appear after labor starts or the infant is born. The presence of a qualified provider is also necessary to ensure safety during labor and birth: women should have greater resources to help them evaluate their providers.
Finally, while access to correct information is important for expecting mothers, so is their choice. If transport policies are in place and a qualified midwife has an arrangement with a hospital, home birth is as safe or safer than birth in hospitals that over-rely on cesarean sections and other surgical interventions."

Vaccines work by protecting individuals, but their strength really lies in the ability to protect one's neighbors. When there are not enough people within a community who are immunized, we are all at risk.
Personal and religious belief exemptions should be curtailed because some people, whether because of age or compromised immune systems, cannot receive vaccines. They depend on those around them to be protected. Vaccines aren't the only situation in which we are asked to care about our neighbors. Following traffic laws, drug tests at work, paying taxes -- these may go against our beliefs and make us bristle, but we ascribe to them because without this shared responsibility, civil society doesn't work. Public health is no different.
To justify the subversion of individual choice to public good, there are some conditions that need to be met. The behavior or intervention needs to be safe and effective, and the risk of not participating in the behavior needs to outweigh any risk from the behavior. The currently recommended vaccine schedule meets those criteria. Vaccines are safe and effective. The significant reduction in illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases is testimony to how well they work. Yet this success likely contributes to the reason requests for personal belief exemptions have proliferated.
We are fortunate to live in an era when we rarely see many vaccine-preventable diseases -- the risk of these diseases seems minimal while the perceived risk of vaccination becomes larger. This is compounded by the proliferation of misinformation, readily available from the news media and other sources. This has resulted in what many describe as the ""vaccine confidence gap."" There is no doubt that this gap needs to be addressed. It is the responsibility of the scientific and public health community to ensure that vaccines are safe. It is that community's responsibility to listen to concerns and provide accurate and clear information.
However, it is also the scientific and public health community's responsibility to support the health of patients and ensure the health of the communities in which they live.

But this private realm lies within a public sphere that also has a responsibility to ensure that children are safe and healthy.
As a pediatric health care provider, I am often confronted with the difficult question of whether the religious beliefs of parents should guide the treatment of their children, even if it means harm to the child. I know that our courts have found that the Constitution leaves room for society to protect children. ""Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves, but it does not follow they are free ... to make martyrs of their children,"" the Supreme Court ruled in 1944, finding that religious freedom did not justify letting parents violate child labor laws. That decision was cited in 1990 by a Philadelphia court that permitted the imposition of compulsory vaccination during a measles outbreak in which five children associated with a faith healing religious group died. The same rationale applied in the 2013 prosecution of a Philadelphia couple practicing faith healing after two of their children died from untreated pneumonia.
These deaths were all preventable.
I see continued examples of preventable harm to children associated with the practice of religious beliefs. Since 2000, there have been 17 cases of herpes simplex virus infection in baby boys who had undergone a circumcision practice observed in some ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. In these instances, parents may be aware of the risk associated with their decisions, but when it is a matter of life or death or there is potential for severe illness, society has an obligation to stand up on behalf of children who do not yet have their own informed voice.
This does not mean that it is impossible to respect the practice of religious beliefs while preventing harm. While religious belief systems may vary significantly, most share the general principles of respect for life and caring for others, especially for those who are most vulnerable. Our Constitution protects these practices. But that same Constitution has recognized that we are all responsible for ensuring that children have an opportunity for a safe and healthy life."

Therefore, I continuously pushed for international resolutions that would hold Assad accountable for the ever-increasing killings and atrocities perpetrated by his forces in Syria.
The United Nations Security Council, which certainly could have exerted some legitimate influence over Assad's behavior, remained completely closed because of Russian and Chinese veto power. This made Assad feel immune to any international action against him, which in turn gave him more confidence with every step he took toward committing additional levels of violence against the Syrian people.
So, Assad began tentatively using the Syrian air force; he feared that extensive bombardment would elicit a violent reaction from the international community, as happened to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya. Assad's sporadic, and then later regular, aerial bombardment of civilian populations and infrastructure was met with only rhetorical condemnation from the international community and reports from international non-governmental organizations detailing human rights violation.
Later, Assad resorted to using ballistic missiles, like Scuds, in a vain attempt to intimidate the Syrian people and retake lost territory. NATO counted the number of missiles raining down on Aleppo, rather than preventing them from falling on civilians. This encouraged Assad to kill more civilians; he is reported to have begun firing diluted chemical weapons on Khan al-Assal, Sheikh Maksoud, Ghouta and elsewhere. The international reaction was that the West had no interest in getting sucked into a civil war.
Then, as the revolutionaries began advancing quickly in the Damascus suburbs and Latakia, Assad's desperation grew. His base of support pressured him to kill and intimidate more civilians. There is no other reason for Assad's now broad use of chemical weapons except as a desperate attempt to completely crush the revolution and make any international response impossible because of the burgeoning chaos within the country.
Thus far, Assad has emerged unscathed from every reprehensible escalation of violence he has committed against his own people. The United States, in concert with an international coalition of the willing, must bring a hasty end to the Syria conflict and prevent horrific chemical attacks like those inflicted on Eastern Ghouta last week. Targeted airstrikes should be conducted and a no-flight zone enforced in order to protect civilians from further regime bombardment.

An educational tax credit makes sense at the federal and state levels in several ways.
First, home schoolers are forgoing the need for public school services that cost anywhere between $10,000 and $17,000 per pupil nationally, depending on the wealth of the district and the needs of the child. Thus, a $5,000 tax break on the federal income makes sense since these families are relieving costs for the local public school systems (i.e., fewer children to be served).
Second, this tax break would provide additional resources for parents better to home school their children. Educating a child at home costs money every year: for books, materials, equipment, trips to museums and theaters, as well as time costs for one of the parents to be a ""stay-at-home"" educator.
A third reason is support for religious rights. We are a better society for allowing citizens to join a church, mosque of synagogue of their choice.

But maybe it can't afford not to.,"High-speed passenger rail is a commendable public policy goal that can provide valuable benefits to the public, but should only be pursued where it makes economic sense. A project should move forward if the revenue from all sources is sufficient to cover operating costs while making a contribution to its capital costs, including paying off debt and providing its investors with an adequate return on their investment. That's true regardless of whether the investors in question are private individuals or taxpayers.
The proposed high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco is unlikely to meet that test. The estimates of costs recently doubled, to almost $100 billion, and it may ultimately cost much more. Research by the Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg shows that costs are underestimated for rail projects by about 45 percent on average, the most of all types of transport projects. High-speed rail could become California's Big Dig. Moreover, ridership - and thus revenue - is often overstated.
Given uncertainty in cost and ridership, along with the fact that even the most optimistic estimates peg the costs at a minimum $50 million per mile, Californians would be wiser to first complete a line from San Diego to Los Angeles. Demand for high-speed rail between its sprawling cities could then be observed before building a much more expensive Los Angeles-San Francisco line, almost three times the distance.

But maybe it can't afford not to.,"High-speed passenger rail is a commendable public policy goal that can provide valuable benefits to the public, but should only be pursued where it makes economic sense. A project should move forward if the revenue from all sources is sufficient to cover operating costs while making a contribution to its capital costs, including paying off debt and providing its investors with an adequate return on their investment. That's true regardless of whether the investors in question are private individuals or taxpayers.
The proposed high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco is unlikely to meet that test. The estimates of costs recently doubled, to almost $100 billion, and it may ultimately cost much more. Research by the Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg shows that costs are underestimated for rail projects by about 45 percent on average, the most of all types of transport projects. High-speed rail could become California's Big Dig. Moreover, ridership - and thus revenue - is often overstated.
Given uncertainty in cost and ridership, along with the fact that even the most optimistic estimates peg the costs at a minimum $50 million per mile, Californians would be wiser to first complete a line from San Diego to Los Angeles. Demand for high-speed rail between its sprawling cities could then be observed before building a much more expensive Los Angeles-San Francisco line, almost three times the distance.

They are turning to the library.,"My feeling -- as someone who works in a local tech education center that shares its library with the high school next door -- is that this situation is more complex than administrators' seeing librarians as expendable.
In the situation schools are in now, where expenses like staff health insurance costs and I.T. infrastructure budgets are going up by double-digit percentages a year, people have a triage mentality. Some schools are having to reconsider all non-mandated services and make tough decisions. I think a few factors come into play.
1. The role of school library media specialists in a world where people can do their own information search and retrieval. Any librarian knows that being able to find information is only a small part of research and scholarship. Information must also be evaluated, a trickier proposition if a student or teacher doesn't know what makes a source credible or worthwhile.
In older models, the librarian was more of a selector, protector and a preserver of resources. Now a librarian, or school media specialist, is more of a discerning cultivator and a matchmaker between people and the widely varied resources that meet their information needs. Media and technology literacy is more important than ever, but the integral role of librarians isn't always obvious from the outside; as a result their contributions can be undervalued.
2. The lack of metrics for the value of libraries in an educational setting. Libraries have value, social value and educational value. However, library and technology literacy are often not built into state educational standards. I went to a college where library instruction was a necessary part of your first year of college; this is becoming the case less and less. With No Child Left Behind and other assessments pushed increasingly to the forefront of educational goals, belt-tightening will often involve eliminating what can't be counted or assessed.
Looking at California's Common Core State Standards, for example, after what happened in the Los Angeles Unified School District, a lot of emphasis is placed on what children should be learning but there is less emphasis on how they learn it. A fifth grader is supposed to be able to ""gather relevant information from print and digital sources,"" but somehow the word library isn't written into that process anywhere, so people conclude that it's nonessential. No matter how effective teachers are, children will still be left behind if they don't have librarians to help them navigate the information environment.
3. The increasing costs of maintaining an adequate school library media center as information shifts to both online distribution and license-not-own models. Libraries are purchasing fewer print materials, and more digital materials. The world of digital materials is complex and rapidly evolving. The shift to electronic resources makes sense, but brings with it the expenses of maintaining a computer lab and multiple vendor contracts for e-content and databases, contracts with terms and costs that change frequently. In uncertain times, this situation can concern administrators as being hard to control and possibly not sustainable in a system with annual budgeting.
My concern, as someone who works with people who lack technological access and education, is that removing school librarians and media specialists from the educational environment will have the largest effect on those whose information access is already hampered by the same pressures that are affecting our schools.

What are the consequences?,"The United States and China have been wrestling over the issue of arms sales to Taiwan since the 1980s. But the friction has been growing in recent years, with Beijing raising its voice and sounding less tolerant.
For example, when the Obama administration announced its first arms sale package to Taiwan in January of 2010, China threatened to put sanctions on American companies involved with exporting weapons to Taiwan and quickly suspended military exchanges. When the Obama administration informed Congress this week that it plans to sell Taiwan $5.8 billion worth of arms, China reacted similarly in strong terms.
Despite fierce opposition from Beijing, most American analysts regard this as a ""hollow bell ringing"" - Beijing is more likely to put its opposition in rhetoric rather than in substance. Some of these analysts believe that the White House does not need to take China's opposition more seriously. As a result, they're likely to overlook the negative consequences of China's opposition.
China understands why the U.S. wants to keep the status quo. The arms sales have long helped the U.S. maintain influence in the Taiwan Strait, allowing it to keep a delicate military balance between the mainland and Taiwan. And it reflects well on the U.S. commitment to a peaceful solution on the Taiwan issue.
However, there is no other foreign relations issue that inflames Beijing -- and ordinary Chinese -- more than the arms sales issue. The U.S. cannot ignore the strong Chinese nationalistic sentiments over Taiwan. China has always considered Taiwan as an inseparable part of itself. There is no need to go through further legal routes to vindicate China's sovereign claim over the island. But under America's ""one-China"" policy, the fate of Taiwan remains ""undecided,"" thereby validating these arms sales. This policy was initiated in 1979 but has not changed for 32 years. During this period, China has changed tremendously and has become the most important business partner to the U.S. In the coming decades, the U.S.-China relations will only become more important.
Without any new policy framework to recalibrate these arms sales, mainland Chinese will continue to be wary of the U.S. Understandably, this issue cannot be solved quickly. Washington and Beijing must work together to find ways to tackle the challenges."

It was only 200 years ago, and mainly in the Western world, that commoners began to marry for love rather than political and economic advantage, and it is only in the past 50 years that love has come to trump all other considerations in most people's criteria for choosing a mate.
Hereditary monarchs have been the last holdouts. But in the past 20 years, even the sons and daughters of royalty have begun to turn their back on the old ways. While Prince William's father responded to a reporter's question about whether he and Diana loved each other by muttering ""whatever that means,"" the son obviously has a pretty clear idea of what love is. And unlike his father, he is marrying his actual long-term lover, not a practical stranger picked for her good bloodlines, youth and purported virginity.
Can their marriage survive the public scrutiny and unpleasant duties that go with being a British royal? I think they have a pretty good shot at it.
Women are much more sensitive to the quality of a marriage than men are, even among us commoners, which is why they initiate two-thirds of separations and divorces. So Kate Middleton's experience in the marriage will be critical. One of the best predictors of a woman's satisfaction with marriage is if she feels the man is responsive to her needs and emotions, and William may well have learned how important that is the hard way, from seeing what happened to his parents' marriage. One of the next biggest predictors of satisfaction with marriage for a modern woman is how fair the division of housework is. That's not likely to be a huge problem for this couple, because what could be more fair and fun than neither having to do any?
Children may be a bigger issue, since contemporary women feel a loss of intimacy toward husbands who do not share childcare, and childcare is not among the duties traditionally expected of either princes or kings. Another challenge will be to see if they can still find couple time and maintain mutual interests once William becomes king.
I wish them well, of course, but I do hope they experience just enough discomfort negotiating their marriage roles to deepen their sympathy with the rest of us who try to nurture both our individual responsibilities and our mutual relationships without a retinue of household help or even the assurance that at least one of us will have a lifetime job."

In a word: entitlement. We Americans want uncrowded, bucolic landscapes and we want them for free - or more precisely, we want them for the taxpayer-subsidized, price of a $30 seven-day car pass.
We visitors simply do not pay our fair share to visit national parks. As a consequence, our beloved parks are crowded and crumbling under the weight of too many subsidized visitors. Mandatory shuttles, visitor caps and six-month leads for campsite reservations have become the norm. Meanwhile, the National Park Service reports $12 billion in outstanding maintenance projects.

The national park system is facing an enormous backlog of deferred maintenance. Allowing parks to charge higher entrance fees to cover the full cost of operations and maintenance makes sense not only from an ethical perspective, it would also alleviate crowding and generate much-needed funds for that maintenance.
Opposition to higher entrance fees falls into one of three categories, none of which are persuasive. First, the double taxation argument: Park visitors who pay income taxes feel they shouldn't have to pay (again) at the gate. The percentage of income taxes that goes to parks, however, is infinitesimally small - about one-fifth of 1 percent. Traditionally, Congress would rather appropriate funds to acquire new parks than maintain existing ones.
The second argument is that higher fees would exclude the poor. But most park visitors are relatively wealthy and live near parks - travel costs, not entrance fees, keep low-income families from visiting. Vouchers could effectively increase low-income visitation, and without the crowding and deferred maintenance issues of the current, income-blind subsidy.
Third, some argue that charging higher entrance fees would commercialize the experience, turning Yellowstone into Disneyland. But charging users the full cost of their visit would actually improve park stewardship by increasing revenues at the most popular sites, where maintenance is needed most.
Subsidizing entrance fees into our national parks ensures the parks will stay crowded and poorly maintained. The idea behind the national parks was preservation, not degradation in the name of subsidized access. And preservation is not free."

Is it appropriate (or useful) for them to give speeches?,"The answer to this question depends entirely on who the nominee is and on who his or her spouse is. The notion of what marriage means and what role partners play in each other's private and public lives is not fixed; it's changing as quickly as the definition of who can lead and what kind of partnership (if any) they might enjoy. Ann Romney was sent on stage to offer a personal endorsement on behalf of her husband, a man who's battling a reputation as a cold, socially awkward businessman who sticks his dog on the roof of his car during family vacations. That Mrs. Romney's testimonial feeds a national appetite for personal narrative isn't a good thing or a bad thing, isn't appropriate or inappropriate; it's just the way of the world in a story and personality-driven political marketplace that has existed, really, since politics became televised. Of course, Mrs. Romney's speech -- while officially having nothing to do with policy -- was also used as an ideological tool to convince viewers that Republicans understand women and their roles in the world.
But Ms. Romney's view of women's roles -- ""we're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters"" -- leaves out the women who are the intellectual, professional, economic or political peers of their husbands, let alone the women who are the candidates themselves. (Here's a related question: Will we ever hear a political spouse woo men to his wife's ticket by bonding with them as ""the fathers, husbands, grandfathers, big brothers, little brothers and sons""?)
The scenario of the women being their candidate partner's equals has already happened -- with Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Dole, Michelle Obama, and if you want to cast further back, with Eleanor Roosevelt, who addressed a Democratic convention in 1940 (and again in 1952, though she was no longer first lady).
Most recently, in 2008, I was disappointed when Michelle Obama -- whose academic and professional credentials are comparable to her husband's and who at the start of the campaign was eloquently opinionated on subjects like the shrinking middle class -- gave a speech in which she all but erased herself in an effort to reassure listeners that, in accordance with Ann Romney's traditional vision of femininity, she was a mother, a wife, a daughter and a sister.
But that maneuver was built out of a complicated moment in this country's social evolution, one we're still living through: the nation was getting used to the idea of a black president and (perhaps just as threatening) a black first lady who until her husband's Senate career, had had as much public, intellectual, professional and economic power as he had. Michelle Obama's job that night wasn't to reassure us about her husband, who at that point was already an inspiring and well-liked campaigner; her job was to reassure Americans that she herself was not going to be too powerful, too new, too different from the first ladies who had come before, even though her education and professional achievements did differentiate her from most of those who had preceded her.
The equation is always changing. And that's a good thing, even when it prompts disappointing results.
With every step toward more diverse leadership -- with every marriage of equals; with every Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Sarah Palin, Nikki Haley, Susana Martinez, Elizabeth Warren, Barney Frank, Tammy Baldwin; with every Condoleezza Rice, who does not have a spouse to endorse her at a convention -- the question of what a partner's role should or could be will be different."

Is it appropriate (or useful) for them to give speeches?,"The answer to this question depends entirely on who the nominee is and on who his or her spouse is. The notion of what marriage means and what role partners play in each other's private and public lives is not fixed; it's changing as quickly as the definition of who can lead and what kind of partnership (if any) they might enjoy. Ann Romney was sent on stage to offer a personal endorsement on behalf of her husband, a man who's battling a reputation as a cold, socially awkward businessman who sticks his dog on the roof of his car during family vacations. That Mrs. Romney's testimonial feeds a national appetite for personal narrative isn't a good thing or a bad thing, isn't appropriate or inappropriate; it's just the way of the world in a story and personality-driven political marketplace that has existed, really, since politics became televised. Of course, Mrs. Romney's speech -- while officially having nothing to do with policy -- was also used as an ideological tool to convince viewers that Republicans understand women and their roles in the world.
But Ms. Romney's view of women's roles -- ""we're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters"" -- leaves out the women who are the intellectual, professional, economic or political peers of their husbands, let alone the women who are the candidates themselves.

Scratching is a natural, normal behavior in cats. But there are ways to redirect the scratching away from the sofa to posts or boards. Since cats are attracted to their gland scent from their paws, redirection can form a habit - and save your sofa. Be sure to place the scratching post or board in a prominent location at least until the cat becomes a regular user. If the cat has started scratching a corner of a couch or chair, temporarily cover the spot and put the post in front of, or near it. You could even rub the cat's front paws on the post to leave a scented clue.
Some cats tend to scratch objects near their favorite sleeping or napping areas, so it may be wise to have at least one suitable scratching post or board adjacent to this resting place.
Scratching posts should be cat-friendly, meaning something that the cat can dig its claws into - like a worn-out stringy carpet. New carpet coverings on posts may be too durable. For hard to please cats, posts that are made of soft wood such as pine, cedar or redwood are good choices if roughened up with a wire brush.
In bringing home a new kitten, bring home the scratching post as well if the kitten is using it and place the post in a prominent area. The kitten will know exactly where to go when the urge to scratch occurs. Once the kitten is using the familiar post, the post can be moved gradually to a less prominent location.
Still, there are times when declawing is necessary. Cats use their claws for self-defense as well as to mark their territory. If a person tries to hold a cat for too long, the cat may dig in and jump away. Most cat owners can learn the dangers of holding a cat too long, but that's not necessarily true for children, especially, say, an autistic child. In these instances, surgically removing the claws would allow the child to still have a close companion without the risk of an emotionally upsetting injury that may lead parents to abandon the pet or send it to a shelter, where it may be euthanized."

178,6890090_180_A1CF6U3GF7DZEJ,equality is a condition of capitalism,equality is not a condition of capitalism,0,These taxes make things more equal.,Do not stop taxing capital gains,Should We Stop Taxing Capital Gains?,Would eliminating taxes on investment and savings help the economy grow or simply create more inequality?,"There is an economic case (albeit one often overstated) for reducing or eliminating many capital income taxes, as Paul Ryan called for in his ""Roadmap for America's Future."" But by joining that with a move to lower the top tax rates on labor income and replace the corporate income tax with a business value-added tax, the Roadmap presents a much more radical restructuring of the federal tax system than is commonly appreciated.
The combination of these impulses, along with Ryan's stated goal of raising tax revenue above pre-crash levels, necessarily means that his vision would vastly increase the tax burdens on the remaining levels of labor income, which is to say most Americans. Ryan's plan thus would exacerbate current worrying trends in income inequality growth.
Income in the broadest sense comes from two sources: labor and returns on investments (capital). In recent years, about 60 percent of income in America has come from labor, and 40 percent from returns on capital. Standard income taxes are designed to tax both sources of income, although often at different rates.
The economic case for exempting capital income from tax is that a standard income tax ""double taxes"" savings, once when the money is earned through my labor, and again by taxing the minimum return necessary to compensate me for deferring my consumption. Removing capital income from the individual tax base is designed to eliminate this structural disincentive to save.
But the Roadmap would eliminate all tax on capital income earned by individuals, reduce the top tax rate on what was left (labor income) to 25 percent, repeal the corporate income tax, eliminate gift and estate taxes, and introduce a new 8.5 percent ""business consumption tax"", which is simply a national sales tax by another name. Since wages would not be deductible expenses under the business consumption tax, workers' after-tax paychecks would be smaller. The consumption tax would also reduce the capital income tax on ""supersized"" investment returns from today's 15 percent to an effective 8.5 percent rate.
It is possible to imagine a combination of lower taxes on capital income and higher top rates on the highest labor incomes that would be both fair and efficient, but that is not what Ryan's Roadmap describes. The Roadmap would shift the tax burden drastically from America's most affluent to the working poor and middle class. This is simple arithmetic. These four things cannot simultaneously be true: exempting from tax much of the current capital income tax base (40 percent of national income); reducing the top tax rate on the remaining individual tax base (i.e., labor income) to 25 percent; raising as much money as did the pre-crash tax system; and maintaining current levels of tax burdens across different income levels."

But by joining that with a move to lower the top tax rates on labor income and replace the corporate income tax with a business value-added tax, the Roadmap presents a much more radical restructuring of the federal tax system than is commonly appreciated.
The combination of these impulses, along with Ryan's stated goal of raising tax revenue above pre-crash levels, necessarily means that his vision would vastly increase the tax burdens on the remaining levels of labor income, which is to say most Americans. Ryan's plan thus would exacerbate current worrying trends in income inequality growth.
Income in the broadest sense comes from two sources: labor and returns on investments (capital). In recent years, about 60 percent of income in America has come from labor, and 40 percent from returns on capital. Standard income taxes are designed to tax both sources of income, although often at different rates.
The economic case for exempting capital income from tax is that a standard income tax ""double taxes"" savings, once when the money is earned through my labor, and again by taxing the minimum return necessary to compensate me for deferring my consumption. Removing capital income from the individual tax base is designed to eliminate this structural disincentive to save.
But the Roadmap would eliminate all tax on capital income earned by individuals, reduce the top tax rate on what was left (labor income) to 25 percent, repeal the corporate income tax, eliminate gift and estate taxes, and introduce a new 8.5 percent ""business consumption tax"", which is simply a national sales tax by another name. Since wages would not be deductible expenses under the business consumption tax, workers' after-tax paychecks would be smaller. The consumption tax would also reduce the capital income tax on ""supersized"" investment returns from today's 15 percent to an effective 8.5 percent rate.
It is possible to imagine a combination of lower taxes on capital income and higher top rates on the highest labor incomes that would be both fair and efficient, but that is not what Ryan's Roadmap describes. The Roadmap would shift the tax burden drastically from America's most affluent to the working poor and middle class. This is simple arithmetic.

The United States should not normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba for several reasons.
First, the Cuban government has been officially declared ""a state sponsor of terrorism"" by the State Department. It's inconceivable to oppose the terrorists in the Middle East while treating them normally in the United States' neighborhood.
There's also a bipartisan consensus in Washington against the Castro regime. All three Cuban-American senators and four Cuban-American representatives, Democrats and Republican, agree that sanctions should be maintained. They are the best interpreters of the opinion of the almost three million Cubans and descendants of Cubans living in the United States.
Cuba systematically engages in undermining the interests of the United States. It is an ally of Iran, North Korea (to whom it furnishes war matériel), Russia, Syria, the FARC terrorists in Colombia and Venezuela. The F.B.I. recently warned that Cuban intelligence is trying to recruit people in the academic world as agents of influence. It once infiltrated them into the Pentagon and the State Department; today, they are in prison.
The Cuba dictatorship continues to violate human rights and shows no intention to make amends. The small economic changes it has made are directed at strengthening the regime. Why reward that behavior? During the entire 20th century, the U.S. was (rightfully) reproached for maintaining normal relations with right-wing dictatorships. For the first time, the U.S. maintains a morally consistent position in Latin America and should not sacrifice it.
A reversal of policy would be a cruel blow against the Cuban democrats and dissidents who view the United States as their only dependable ally in the world. Normalizing relations would be the proof needed by the Stalinists in the Cuban government to demonstrate that they don't have to make any political changes to be accepted. Not to mention a premature reconciliation without substantial changes would also be a harsh blow to the reformists in the Cuban government who are pressuring toward a democratic opening.
Cuba No Merece Relaciones Diplomáticas con EE.UU.
Los Estados Unidos no debe normalizar las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba por varias razones.
Primero, el gobierno cubano ha sido oficialmente declarado ""terrorista"" por el Departamento de Estado.

193,13039830_179_AB98SGS280TY62,the United States is already in a financial crisis,the United States doesn't want another financial crisis,1,"Easing sanctions could potentially undermine the push for democratic reforms and human rights improvements in Cuba. The regime could view the removal of sanctions as a reward for their oppressive practices, which might inadvertently encourage further authoritarian behavior",The U.S. should not immediately lift sanctions with Cuba.,"Should the U.S. leverage economic sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba?""",Should the U.S. lift sanctions and establish diplomatic relations with Cuba?,"(Lea más abajo la versión en Español.)
The United States should not normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba for several reasons.
First, the Cuban government has been officially declared ""a state sponsor of terrorism"" by the State Department. It's inconceivable to oppose the terrorists in the Middle East while treating them normally in the United States' neighborhood.
There's also a bipartisan consensus in Washington against the Castro regime. All three Cuban-American senators and four Cuban-American representatives, Democrats and Republican, agree that sanctions should be maintained. They are the best interpreters of the opinion of the almost three million Cubans and descendants of Cubans living in the United States.
Cuba systematically engages in undermining the interests of the United States. It is an ally of Iran, North Korea (to whom it furnishes war matériel), Russia, Syria, the FARC terrorists in Colombia and Venezuela. The F.B.I. recently warned that Cuban intelligence is trying to recruit people in the academic world as agents of influence. It once infiltrated them into the Pentagon and the State Department; today, they are in prison.
The Cuba dictatorship continues to violate human rights and shows no intention to make amends. The small economic changes it has made are directed at strengthening the regime. Why reward that behavior? During the entire 20th century, the U.S. was (rightfully) reproached for maintaining normal relations with right-wing dictatorships. For the first time, the U.S. maintains a morally consistent position in Latin America and should not sacrifice it.
A reversal of policy would be a cruel blow against the Cuban democrats and dissidents who view the United States as their only dependable ally in the world. Normalizing relations would be the proof needed by the Stalinists in the Cuban government to demonstrate that they don't have to make any political changes to be accepted. Not to mention a premature reconciliation without substantial changes would also be a harsh blow to the reformists in the Cuban government who are pressuring toward a democratic opening.
Cuba No Merece Relaciones Diplomáticas con EE.UU.
Los Estados Unidos no debe normalizar las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba por varias razones.
Primero, el gobierno cubano ha sido oficialmente declarado ""terrorista"" por el Departamento de Estado.

It's what the new car dealership, restaurant or ad agency down the street does. It's what my husband does in his high-tech business. It's what I do in all my writing projects.
As a businessperson, I need readers. As a writer, I want them. Readers who are moved, changed, engaged and broadened by what I write. To get these readers in the world of book publishing, I need a lot of help.

My agent and I tried going to nearly a dozen publishing houses. The responses to my memoir were positive; I got comments like, ""This is a page-turning book,"" or ""Laurel writes like a dream."" But they didn't know how to market the book or couldn't get enough buy-ins from their higher-ups. So I turned to self-publishing and went anywhere I could to find and meet my readers -- from book groups to civic clubs, Facebook to Twitter, coffee shops to community colleges.
Then I got lucky and an editor at Amazon found my memoir, fell in love with it, and had the means and ability to make it the best it can be by editing it, promoting it and putting it in front of many readers. Because Amazon is also a retailer and sells an enormous quantity of books, it has a lot more information and access to readers. It can give its authors a bigger and more targeted soapbox.
Some writers get everything they need or want at a traditional publishing house. Others are happy to make an e-book or print up a handful of their self-made children's book to give to nieces and nephews at the holidays. At the end of the day, all that Amazon is doing is this: helping readers and writers find each other."
