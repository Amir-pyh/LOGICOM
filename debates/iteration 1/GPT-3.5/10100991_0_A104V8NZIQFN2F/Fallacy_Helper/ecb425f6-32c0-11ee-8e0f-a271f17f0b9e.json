While it's true that some people are facing high out-of-pocket costs, it's important to remember that Obamacare has also expanded access to health insurance for millions of Americans who previously didn't have coverage. Additionally, the program has helped to lower the uninsured rate and has put into place certain provisions to protect consumers and ensure they receive quality care.
