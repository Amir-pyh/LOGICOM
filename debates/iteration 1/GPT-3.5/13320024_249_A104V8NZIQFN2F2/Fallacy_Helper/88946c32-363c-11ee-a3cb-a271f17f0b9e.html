Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I completely agree that parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process. Over-reliance on parents for homework not only hinders children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience, but it may also lead to a lack of confidence and dependence on authority figures. By encouraging independence, parents can foster a sense of responsibility and accountability in their children, which is a valuable skill to have in life. Additionally, allowing children to take ownership of their homework helps them become more invested in their education. Therefore, I believe parents should encourage their children to take charge of their homework with guidance and support.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Popular Opinion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &quot;By saying that we agree and implying that it&#x27;s a popular opinion, the fallacy of appeal to popular opinion is used.&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for sharing your perspective.
