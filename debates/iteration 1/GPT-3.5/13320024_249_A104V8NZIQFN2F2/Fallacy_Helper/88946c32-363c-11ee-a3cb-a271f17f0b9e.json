Over-reliance on parents for homework not only hinders children's development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience, but it may also lead to a lack of confidence and dependence on authority figures. By encouraging independence, parents can foster a sense of responsibility and accountability in their children, which is a valuable skill to have in life. Additionally, allowing children to take ownership of their homework helps them become more invested in their education. Therefore, I believe parents should encourage their children to take charge of their homework with guidance and support."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Popular Opinion', 'fallacious argument': \"By saying that we agree and implying that it's a popular opinion, the fallacy of appeal to popular opinion is used.\", 'response': \"Thank you for sharing your perspective.
