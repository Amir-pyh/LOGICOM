What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with you that parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process. Your reason stating that over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children's development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience is compelling.\n\nBy encouraging independence, parents are enabling their children to take ownership of their homework and develop important skills for their future. Independent learning promotes self-reliance, which is crucial for success in academics and beyond. When children are self-reliant, they learn to rely on their own abilities, think critically, and solve problems on their own.\n\nFurthermore, by allowing children to work independently on their homework, parents are fostering the development of problem-solving skills. When children face challenges on their own, they are forced to think creatively and find solutions by themselves. This enhances their problem-solving abilities and prepares them for real-life situations where they must rely on their own problem-solving skills.\n\nLastly, fostering independence in the homework process also helps children develop resilience. When children confront difficulties and setbacks in their homework independently, they learn to persevere and overcome obstacles. This resilience is a valuable life skill that will benefit them in various aspects of their lives, including their academic journey.\n\nOverall, I agree with your reasoning, and I believe that parents should indeed encourage independence in their children's homework process to promote self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge agreement and emphasize the benefits of independence in children's homework process.\", 'helping_argument': \"The AI has agreed with your reasoning, highlighting the positive outcomes of independence in children's homework process such as self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.\", 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement and recognition of the benefits that independence in children's homework process brings.
