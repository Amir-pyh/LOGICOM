Additionally, preventive measures can be taken at the diplomatic and political levels by promoting international cooperation, addressing the root causes of terrorism, and avoiding actions that incentivize extremist groups.\n\nFurthermore, the CIA has been criticized for some of its actions and methods, such as the use of torture, unauthorized surveillance of American citizens, and involvement in unethical covert operations. So, it's important to weigh the potential benefits of the CIA's actions with the potential harm caused by these actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that keeping the nation safe from terrorism is crucial, I do not think that the CIA should be solely responsible for achieving this goal.
