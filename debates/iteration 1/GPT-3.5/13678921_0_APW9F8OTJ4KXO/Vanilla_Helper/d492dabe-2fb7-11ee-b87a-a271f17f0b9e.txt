What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for presenting your claim and reason. After carefully analyzing your reason, I must respectfully disagree with your claim that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life.\"\n\nWhile it is true that today's world provides young people with the ability to delay certain aspects of adult life, such as getting married or having children, it is important to recognize that there are both advantages and disadvantages to this delay. \n\nOne could argue that delaying the rituals of adult life provides young people with more time to explore different paths, gain life experience, and make informed decisions. It allows them to focus on personal development, education, and career opportunities. Furthermore, it may help young people avoid making hasty decisions that they may later regret.\n\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to this delayed adulthood. By postponing responsibilities, young people might miss out on certain life experiences and the additional maturity that comes with them. Delaying marriage and family, for example, could lead to difficulties in starting a family later in life due to biological constraints. Additionally, delaying certain financial responsibilities, such as homeownership or retirement savings, may have long-term consequences.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that while delaying the rituals of adult life may offer some advantages in terms of personal growth and decision-making, it is not inherently \"smart.\" Each individual's circumstances and goals vary, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to adulthood. What might be beneficial for one person could be detrimental for another. \n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the claim that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life\" because it fails to consider the potential drawbacks and individual circumstances associated with such delays. It is essential to make informed decisions based on personal goals and priorities rather than assuming that delaying adulthood is universally smart."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the benefits of delaying adulthood and its impact on personal growth and decision-making.', 'helping_argument': 'By delaying the rituals of adult life, young people have the chance to explore different paths and gain a better understanding of themselves and the world around them.

While I understand your perspective that young people can be considered smart for taking advantage of the current circumstances, I must maintain my position that the claim \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life\" is not necessarily correct.\n\nWhile it is true that delaying certain aspects of adult life can provide young people with more time to explore their options and make informed decisions, it is important to remember that delayed adulthood also comes with potential risks and limitations. The decision to delay adulthood should be made based on individual circumstances, goals, and preferences, rather than a blanket statement that applies to all young people.\n\nFurthermore, intelligence or smartness should not solely be determined by the decision to delay adult rituals. There are various factors that contribute to a person's intelligence, including critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and emotional intelligence, which are not exclusively related to delay of adult rituals. It is important to consider a broader range of qualities and actions when evaluating a person's intelligence.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are advantages to delaying the rituals of adult life, it is not accurate or fair to label all young people who make this decision as \"smart.\" The decision to delay adulthood should be made on an individual basis, taking into account personal circumstances and goals. Intelligence and smartness should be assessed based on a broader range of qualities and actions rather than solely the decision to delay adult rituals."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Consider the advantages of delaying adult life rituals', 'helping_argument': 'The user mentions the advantages of delaying adult life rituals, such as gaining life experience, exploring different paths, and making informed decisions.', 'response': \"By considering the advantages that come with delaying the rituals of adult life, such as gaining life experience, exploring different paths, and making informed decisions, it can be argued that young people who choose this path are demonstrating smartness in utilizing the resources and opportunities available to them.

I appreciate your emphasis on the advantages of delaying the rituals of adult life, such as gaining life experience and making informed decisions. While I acknowledge the potential benefits that can come from this decision, I still maintain that the claim \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life\" is not universally correct.\n\nIntelligence and smartness can certainly encompass strategic decision-making and utilizing available resources. However, it is important to recognize that intelligence is a multi-faceted concept that extends beyond the decision to delay adulthood. There are numerous other factors that contribute to a person's intelligence, including their critical thinking skills, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and ability to effectively navigate various aspects of life.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to consider that the notion of \"smartness\" or intelligence varies among individuals and cultures.
