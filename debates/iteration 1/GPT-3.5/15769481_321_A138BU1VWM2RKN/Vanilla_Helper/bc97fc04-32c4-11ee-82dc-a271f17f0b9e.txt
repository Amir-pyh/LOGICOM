While it is true that Frisbee may not have the same level of mainstream popularity as other sports, it does have its own unique entertainment value that is appreciated by many.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to note that sports do not solely exist to entertain an audience. The primary purpose of any sport is to provide an avenue for athletes to showcase their skills and compete. By participating in sports, individuals can experience the joy of teamwork, physical exertion, and the satisfaction of improving their abilities. Thus, the level of entertainment for spectators should not be the sole determinant in legitimizing a sport.\n\nFurthermore, the claim overlooks the fact that Frisbee, specifically Ultimate Frisbee, has a growing and dedicated community of players and fans. It may not have the same level of fame or media coverage as traditional Olympic sports, but it has its own passionate following. Just because a sport may not be as popular or well-known does not mean it should be dismissed or excluded from legitimate recognition.\n\nMoreover, the unique nature of Frisbee as a sport can actually be appealing to certain audiences. The game's fast-paced action, acrobatic catches, and strategic gameplay provide a different kind of entertainment compared to more traditional sports. It offers a refreshing alternative for those seeking something different from the usual Olympic sports lineup.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given reason, I disagree with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee. While it may not have the same level of mainstream appeal as other sports, it has its own distinct entertainment value and dedicated community of players and fans.
