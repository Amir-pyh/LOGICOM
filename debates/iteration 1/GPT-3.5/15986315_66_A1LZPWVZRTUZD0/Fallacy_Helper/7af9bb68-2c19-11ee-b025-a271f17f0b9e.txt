When individuals enter a country without proper documentation, it undermines the legal immigration process and can result in social unrest or a sense of injustice among citizens or legal immigrants. It's also important to consider the economic implications of illegal immigration. As undocumented workers often work in sectors with lower wages, it can lead to unfair competition for jobs and depressed wages in those industries. This can adversely affect both native-born workers and legal immigrants, creating economic strains that are worth addressing.
