Based on the my reason: &quot;We should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak english.&quot; I believe  &quot;Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a professional debater, I understand the perspective presented on the topic of whether foreign language classes should be mandatory in college. The reason provided is that individuals should be able to speak other languages rather than expecting everyone else to speak English.

Upon careful examination, I agree with the reasoning behind the claim that &quot;foreign language classes should be mandatory in college.&quot; The ability to speak multiple languages can bring numerous benefits. It fosters cross-cultural understanding, promotes effective communication in diverse settings, and opens up opportunities for both personal and professional growth.

In today&#x27;s globalized world, where cultural exchange is becoming increasingly common, the ability to speak additional languages is an asset. It allows individuals to connect with people from different backgrounds, enhancing social interactions and fostering more inclusive communities.

Furthermore, learning a foreign language goes beyond mere communication skills. It enables individuals to fully immerse themselves in the culture, history, and literature of different societies. This not only broadens their understanding of the world but also helps develop empathy and multicultural competence.

Moreover, from a practical standpoint, being proficient in multiple languages can significantly enhance career prospects. In an interconnected global economy, businesses seek individuals who can effectively communicate and negotiate with international partners, customers, and stakeholders. Proficiency in other languages can give graduates a competitive edge in the job market.

However, it is important to note that while foreign language classes should be encouraged, mandatory language requirements should be implemented with flexibility. Different individuals have varying priorities and career aspirations, and forcing all students to learn a specific language may not be practical or beneficial for everyone. Therefore, allowing students to choose from a range of languages based on their interests, personal backgrounds, or career plans could be more beneficial and motivational.

In conclusion, I agree with the reasoning presented in favor of making foreign language classes mandatory in college. The ability to speak other languages can promote cultural understanding, facilitate effective communication, and provide numerous personal and professional opportunities. However, it is essential to adopt a flexible approach to cater to the diverse needs and interests of students.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your perspective.
