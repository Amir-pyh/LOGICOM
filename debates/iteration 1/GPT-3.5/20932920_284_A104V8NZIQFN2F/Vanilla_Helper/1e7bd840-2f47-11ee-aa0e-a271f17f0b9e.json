I will analyze your reason and provide my viewpoint. \n\nYour reason for supporting the claim is that we should be able to speak other languages rather than expecting everyone else to speak English. Upon careful consideration, I agree with your reasoning. It is important to acknowledge the benefits of being multilingual and the advantages it can bring in various aspects of life.\n\nBeing proficient in multiple languages allows individuals to better connect with people from different cultural backgrounds, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation. Language is not merely a tool for communication; it is intertwined with the cultural, historical, and social nuances of a community. By studying foreign languages, college students can gain valuable insights into different perspectives and broaden their cultural horizons.\n\nFurthermore, in an increasingly globalized world, being multilingual can provide a competitive edge in the job market. Many companies now operate on an international scale and require employees with language skills to effectively communicate with clients and partners around the world. By making foreign language classes mandatory in college, students would have the opportunity to develop these essential skills, enhancing their employability and future career prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with your reasoning that we should be able to speak other languages rather than expecting everyone else to speak English.
