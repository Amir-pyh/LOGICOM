I respectfully disagree with your claim that \"We should not manipulate our dreams.\"\n\nWhile it is true that the Senoi Indians consider the dream state to be of equal importance to the wakeful state, it is important to note that dream manipulation does not necessarily diminish the significance of the dreaming experience. Rather, it offers a tool to actively engage with and explore our subconscious minds.\n\nThe act of manipulating dreams involves becoming more aware of the dream state and potentially gaining greater control over one's subconscious thoughts and emotions. Through a practice like lucid dreaming, one can intentionally guide their dreams towards positive outcomes, such as overcoming fears or gaining insight into personal issues.\n\nFurthermore, dream manipulation can also serve as a therapeutic tool, particularly for individuals struggling with PTSD or severe anxiety. By confronting and processing traumatic experiences in a controlled dream environment, individuals can potentially find resolution and healing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the dream state certainly holds significant value and should be respected as such, the act of manipulating dreams offers unique opportunities for personal growth and healing.
