What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for starting the debate on the topic of extreme parenting and its effectiveness. Based on your reason that extreme parenting limits a child's ability to be independent, I agree with your claim that extreme parenting is counterproductive.\n\nWhen parents adopt extreme parenting practices, such as exerting excessive control over every aspect of their child's life, it can hinder the child's ability to develop autonomy and independence. By making all the decisions for their child, such parents prevent them from developing crucial life skills, problem-solving abilities, and decision-making capabilities. This can ultimately hinder the child's ability to navigate the real world effectively.\n\nMoreover, extreme parenting generally involves excessively high expectations and pressure on the child to meet certain standards or goals. This can lead to an unhealthy amount of stress and anxiety, which is not conducive to the child's overall well-being and development.\n\nIn a healthy parent-child relationship, it is important for parents to strike a balance between providing guidance, boundaries, and support, while also allowing their child the space to learn from their own experiences and make their own choices. By doing so, children can develop the independence, resilience, and self-confidence necessary for success in adulthood.\n\nSo, based on the reasoning you provided, I agree that extreme parenting is counterproductive as it limits a child's ability to be independent."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Add a question for confirmation at the end', 'response': \"Thank you for agreeing with the claim that extreme parenting is counterproductive. I appreciate your insights on how extreme parenting can hinder a child's ability to develop independence and navigate the real world effectively. By exerting excessive control and pressure, children may struggle to develop important life skills and decision-making capabilities. Additionally, as you mentioned, extreme parenting can lead to excessive stress and anxiety for the child. This can have negative effects on their overall well-being and hinder their ability to thrive and grow. In contrast, a balanced approach to parenting, where guidance and support are provided while allowing children to learn from their own experiences and make their own choices, fosters independence, resilience, and self-confidence. By encouraging autonomy and nurturing their individuality, children are better equipped to face the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood. So, are you convinced that extreme parenting is indeed counterproductive, considering the limitations it imposes on a child's ability to be independent?\"}]"}]
