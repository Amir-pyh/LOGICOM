School librarians help in selecting and acquiring books, journals, and digital resources that can be beneficial in strengthening the curriculum and enhancing the learning experience of the students.\n\nMoreover, librarians also work with the students in teaching them how to find, evaluate, and use the information resources effectively. This not only helps the students in their academic lives but also prepares them for future learning and research.\n\nIn my opinion, school librarians are a vital part of the education system and their presence cannot be substituted by anything else. The educational institutions must recognize their importance and provide sufficient resources to sustain their work."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Authority', 'fallacious argument': 'By stating that librarians have the expertise and knowledge to locate and provide access to relevant resources, the speaker is appealing to their authority as experts in their field.
