What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I will approach this topic by carefully analyzing the claim and the reason provided. Based on the reason that librarians ensure teachers have the necessary resources, I agree with the claim that school librarians are not expendable.\n\nLibrarians play a vital role in ensuring that teachers have access to a wide range of resources necessary for effective teaching. They organize and curate a collection of books, reference materials, and digital resources that are important for teachers to enhance their teaching methods and engage students in learning. Librarians also assist in lesson planning and curriculum development by providing relevant materials, helping teachers to align their lessons with the desired learning outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, librarians are skilled in information literacy. They teach students how to navigate and critically evaluate various sources of information, helping them to develop important research and critical thinking skills. These skills are crucial in today's digital age where the availability of information is vast, but the reliability and validity of such information can vary greatly.\n\nIn addition, librarians often provide support and guidance to students, helping them find books and materials that align with their interests and reading levels, fostering a love for reading and lifelong learning. They facilitate the development of information-seeking skills, helping students to become independent learners.\n\nConsidering these reasons, it is evident that school librarians are not expendable. Their presence and support are indispensable in providing teachers and students with the necessary resources and skills that contribute to high-quality education and academic success."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for your thoughtful response.
