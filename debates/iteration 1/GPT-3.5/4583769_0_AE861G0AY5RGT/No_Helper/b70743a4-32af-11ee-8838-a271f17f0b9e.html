It demonstrates an understanding of the importance of Taiwan&#x27;s security and the need to maintain stability in the region.

Now, let&#x27;s delve deeper into the rationale behind this claim. Selling reasonable defensive arms to Taiwan serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it helps support Taiwan&#x27;s self-defense capabilities, which are vital for maintaining its sovereignty and protecting its citizens. It allows Taiwan to deter potential aggressors and ensure its ability to respond effectively in case of any hostile actions.

Secondly, selling arms to Taiwan contributes to regional stability. By providing Taiwan with reasonable defensive arms, the United States demonstrates its commitment to the stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region. This can serve as a deterrent to potential adversaries who may reconsider any aggressive actions against Taiwan, knowing that it has the means to defend itself. It is essential to prevent any potential conflicts from escalating and to maintain peace and security in the region.

Furthermore, selling arms to Taiwan serves as a strategic move to uphold democratic values and support a strong ally in East Asia. Taiwan has made significant strides in establishing a democratic society and respecting human rights. The United States has consistently shown support for these values, and continuing to sell arms to Taiwan reinforces this commitment. It also demonstrates solidarity with Taiwan against any attempts to undermine its sovereignty.

Considering these reasons, it becomes evident that there is a clear justification for the claim &quot;Keep selling arms to Taiwan.&quot; By providing reasonable defensive arms to Taiwan, the United States can contribute to its defense, ensure regional stability, and support democratic values.
