Based on your reason that other reading platforms and the enduring demand for physical books ensure publishers' relevance, I agree with your claim that \"Amazon will not necessarily kill off publishers.\" \n\nIt is true that while Amazon may have a dominant presence in the book market, there are still other reading platforms available that allow publishers to reach a wide audience.
