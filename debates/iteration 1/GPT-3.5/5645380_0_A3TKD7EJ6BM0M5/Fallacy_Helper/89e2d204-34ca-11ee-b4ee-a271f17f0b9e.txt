Denying individuals access to higher education based on their perceived abilities or aptitudes can limit their potential and hinder societal progress.\n\nTherefore, I respectfully disagree with the claim that \"College not free for everyone\" and believe that higher education should be accessible and affordable for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic background or perceived abilities."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'False information', 'fallacious argument': 'providing false information about career paths and alternatives to college education', 'response': \"Thank you for sharing your perspective. While I understand your viewpoint, I still stand by my claim that 'College not free for everyone' is correct.
