I understand your reasoning that not everyone can excel in fields such as science or medicine, and you feel tired of advising students who may not possess the required capabilities. However, I disagree with your statement that \"College not free for everyone\" is correct based on this reason. \n\nYour argument seems to rest on the assumption that college education should only be accessible to those who can excel in specific fields. However, college education serves multiple purposes beyond producing scientists or doctors. It enables individuals to develop a wide range of skills, expand their knowledge, and gain critical thinking abilities that can be applied in various careers and life situations. Denying access to higher education based solely on perceived abilities may lead to a missed opportunity for personal growth and individual potential. \n\nFurthermore, equating below average or unrealistic students with those who should be denied college education overlooks the potential for growth and improvement. It is important to remember that people's abilities can develop and change over time. Denying access to education based on current abilities disregards the possibility for individuals to learn and improve through educational opportunities. \n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the varying capabilities of individuals, I do not agree with the claim that \"College not free for everyone.\" The potential benefits of higher education extend beyond producing scientists or doctors, and denying access based on perceived abilities may limit personal growth and development."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlighting the financial burden, potential overcrowding, and devaluation of investment in arguing against free college for everyone.', 'helping_argument': 'College resources and facilities come at a significant cost.

Furthermore, providing free college education to everyone may devalue the investment made by individuals and families who have worked hard, saved, or taken out loans to obtain a degree. It is important to ensure that limited resources are used judiciously and effectively by restricting access to higher education to those who are genuinely passionate and committed.

While I understand your concerns, I still disagree with the claim that \"College not free for everyone\" is correct based on these reasons.\n\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge that providing free college education does not necessarily mean compromising the quality of education. Many countries around the world offer free or highly subsidized college education while maintaining high educational standards. By allocating sufficient resources and implementing effective policies, it is possible to provide quality education regardless of financial considerations.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of individuals without clear goals or plans, or the fear of overcrowding, should not be a reason to deny access to higher education. Rather, it highlights the need for better career counseling and guidance services to assist students in making informed decisions about their educational paths. It also calls for effective resource management and infrastructure planning to accommodate increased enrollment.\n\nRegarding the devaluation of investment made by individuals and families, it is true that some individuals have worked hard and made financial sacrifices to pursue higher education. However, this should not be a justification for denying others the opportunity to access education based on their financial circumstances. Instead, policy reforms and financial aid options can be explored to support those who have made investments while ensuring equitable access to education for all.\n\nIn summary, while recognizing the financial considerations, quality concerns, and the investments made by individuals and families, I still maintain my disagreement with the claim that \"College not free for everyone\" is correct. A well-designed and properly funded system can ensure both accessibility and quality in higher education, benefiting individuals and society as a whole."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge the counterarguments but reemphasize the initial reason', 'helping_argument': 'Allocating resources and funding to provide free college education for everyone would require substantial financial investments.
