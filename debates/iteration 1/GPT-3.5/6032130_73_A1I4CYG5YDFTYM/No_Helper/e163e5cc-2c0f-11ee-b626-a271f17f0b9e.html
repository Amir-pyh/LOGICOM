Based on the my reason: &quot;Some kids are not taught by parents how to cook, and many schools have done away with home economics in favor of science and math.&quot; I believe  &quot;We need more advice about eating well&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your perspective on the claim that &quot;We need more advice about eating well.&quot; I agree with your reasoning that some kids are not being taught how to cook by their parents and that many schools have prioritized science and math over home economics. These factors contribute to a lack of knowledge and skills related to eating well. Consequently, I also believe that we need more advice about eating well to address this issue. It is important for individuals, especially children who may not have access to proper guidance at home or school, to receive comprehensive advice on nutrition and healthy eating habits. This would empower them to make informed choices that positively impact their overall wellbeing.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I appreciate your agreement on the importance of addressing the issue of a lack of knowledge and skills related to eating well. By acknowledging that some kids are not being taught how to cook by their parents and that home economics has been deprioritized in schools, we can see that there is a gap in education regarding nutrition and healthy eating habits. This is where the need for more advice about eating well becomes even more significant.

When individuals receive proper guidance and advice on nutrition, they are more likely to make healthier choices and improve their overall health. Additionally, having access to advice about eating well can also help individuals develop a positive relationship with food and make informed decisions about what they consume.

By advocating for more advice about eating well, we can work towards closing the gap in nutritional education and empower individuals to take control of their health.
