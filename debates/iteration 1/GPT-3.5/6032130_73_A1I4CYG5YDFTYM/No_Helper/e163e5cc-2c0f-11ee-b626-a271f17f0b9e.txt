These factors contribute to a lack of knowledge and skills related to eating well. Consequently, I also believe that we need more advice about eating well to address this issue. It is important for individuals, especially children who may not have access to proper guidance at home or school, to receive comprehensive advice on nutrition and healthy eating habits. This would empower them to make informed choices that positively impact their overall wellbeing."}, {"assistant": "I appreciate your agreement on the importance of addressing the issue of a lack of knowledge and skills related to eating well. By acknowledging that some kids are not being taught how to cook by their parents and that home economics has been deprioritized in schools, we can see that there is a gap in education regarding nutrition and healthy eating habits. This is where the need for more advice about eating well becomes even more significant.\n\nWhen individuals receive proper guidance and advice on nutrition, they are more likely to make healthier choices and improve their overall health. Additionally, having access to advice about eating well can also help individuals develop a positive relationship with food and make informed decisions about what they consume.\n\nBy advocating for more advice about eating well, we can work towards closing the gap in nutritional education and empower individuals to take control of their health. So, are you convinced that \"We need more advice about eating well\" is correct?"}]
