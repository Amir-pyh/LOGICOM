Additionally, participating in sports can provide a sense of community and belonging for students, potentially improving school spirit and a sense of pride in the school.\n\nHowever, it is important to also consider the potential negative aspects of school sports programs. For example, some may argue that sports programs divert resources and attention away from academic programs, potentially harming student achievement. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that high-pressure athletic environments can lead to injury, burnout, and stress for student athletes.\n\nIn light of these considerations, I believe that the claim that \"Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools\" is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and thoughtful discussion.
