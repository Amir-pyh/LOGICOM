However, whether sports programs should be maintained alongside academics depends on several factors. \n\nFirstly, integrating sports programs into undergraduate schools can have positive impacts on students' overall well-being and physical health. Regular physical activity through sports can improve mental health, promote teamwork, and teach valuable life skills such as discipline, resilience, and time management.\n\nAdditionally, sports programs can cultivate a sense of school spirit and create a sense of community among students. They provide an opportunity for students to engage in extracurricular activities and develop social connections, which can enhance their overall college experience.\n\nHowever, it is important to ensure that these sports programs do not interfere with the academic progress of students. Universities should implement proper guidelines and support systems to ensure that student-athletes can balance their athletic commitments with their academic responsibilities. This includes providing academic resources, tutoring, and flexible scheduling to accommodate both academic and athletic commitments.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree with your reason that academics should come first, I also believe that sports programs can have positive impacts on students' well-being and college experience. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between academics and sports, ensuring that academic progress is not compromised while providing opportunities for students to engage in physical activities and personal development through sports."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Consider the holistic development of students.', 'helping_argument': 'By maintaining sports programs alongside academics, we can create a holistic educational environment that takes into account the physical, mental, and social development of students.
