However, it's important to consider other factors as well. \n\nFor example, some diners may not be able to afford to tip or may not believe in the practice of tipping altogether. Additionally, the responsibility of paying a fair wage to servers should ultimately fall on the employer, rather than on the customer. \n\nTherefore, I cannot fully agree or disagree with the claim \"To tip\" without considering these other factors.
