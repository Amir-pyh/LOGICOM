Let's analyze your reason: \"Diners may not be able to select the server, but they can compensate them according to their service.\"\n\nIt is true that diners do not have control over which server assists them at a restaurant. However, tipping is a way for diners to show appreciation and compensate their server for their service. By tipping, diners have the opportunity to reward excellent service or provide constructive feedback through an adjusted tip amount. This system helps create an incentive for servers to provide a higher level of service since their compensation is partially dependent on it.\n\nI agree with your reason that diners have the ability to compensate servers based on their service. Tipping provides a direct means for customers to express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the service, while also serving as a form of acknowledgment for the efforts of the server. In this way, tipping acts as a feedback mechanism and serves the purpose of ensuring a positive dining experience for customers.\n\nOverall, I support the concept of tipping as it allows diners to have a direct impact on how servers are compensated based on the quality of service they provide."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Focus on confirming the claim with the AI.', 'helping_argument': \"I acknowledged AI's agreement and asked for confirmation.\", 'response': \"Thank you for acknowledging the reason behind the claim 'To tip'.
