Let's delve deeper into the reason you have provided for your claim.\n\nWhile it is true that Syria's issues may not directly involve the United States, it can be argued that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in situations where human rights abuses and war crimes are being committed. The use of chemical weapons in Syria is a violation of international law, and the world has a duty to prevent their use.\n\nFurthermore, the United States has a history of intervening in global conflicts for humanitarian reasons. In the past, the US has intervened in conflicts such as the Kosovo War and the Rwandan Genocide in order to stop mass atrocities.\n\nWhile military intervention should always be a last resort, it is important to consider all options when addressing a humanitarian crisis. In this case, it is possible that there are non-military solutions to the crisis in Syria, such as diplomatic efforts and aid to refugees. However, the decision to take military action should not be dismissed outright without considering all factors and potential consequences.\n\nBased on this analysis, I cannot fully agree with your reason that \"not our fight\" is a sufficient justification for the US not to intervene in Syria.
