By preventing employees from pursuing future career opportunities, noncompete agreements indeed hinder personal and professional growth. When companies enforce such agreements, they limit their employees' ability to explore their full potential and make the best use of their talents. This not only restricts individual growth but also impedes the overall progress of the job market. So, are you convinced that 'Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals' is correct?\"}]"}]
