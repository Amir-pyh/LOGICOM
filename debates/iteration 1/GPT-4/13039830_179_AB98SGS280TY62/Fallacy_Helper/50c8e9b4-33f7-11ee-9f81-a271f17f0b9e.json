The regime could view the removal of sanctions as a reward for their oppressive practices, which might inadvertently encourage further authoritarian behavior.\" Thus, I agree with your claim that \"The U.S. should not immediately lift sanctions with Cuba,\" as it is important to ensure that the progress towards democracy and human rights is not jeopardized."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'False dilemma', 'fallacious argument': 'By presenting the argument as a choice between maintaining sanctions and immediately lifting them, the false dilemma fallacy is employed.

It is indeed crucial to consider the potential consequences of easing sanctions too quickly. By maintaining sanctions, we can maintain the pressure on the Cuban regime and encourage them to prioritize democratic reforms and human rights improvements. The regime needs to understand that positive changes are necessary before the sanctions can be lifted.
