What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a professional debater, I understand and appreciate your perspective. Your reason, namely &quot;Easing sanctions could potentially undermine the push for democratic reforms and human rights improvements in Cuba. The regime could view the removal of sanctions as a reward for their oppressive practices, which might inadvertently encourage further authoritarian behavior&quot; presents a valid concern about the negative implications of lifting sanctions impulsively.

I agree with this reasoning. It&#x27;s crucial that any actions taken by international powers like the US must be strategically aimed at promoting democracy and human rights. Therefore, it would be safest not to lift sanctions immediately, as doing so may inadvertently embolden oppressive regimes, thereby defeating the purpose of the sanctions in the first place. Thus, I concur with your perspective that &quot;The U.S. should not immediately lift sanctions with Cuba.&quot; due to the potential to inadvertently reinforce authoritarian behavior.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Consider the long-term effects and encourage positive change.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;By maintaining sanctions, we can continue to apply pressure on the Cuban regime to promote democratic reforms and human rights improvements.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your understanding of the potential consequences of immediately lifting sanctions.
