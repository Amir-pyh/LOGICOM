topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;
reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a critical thinker, I agree to a certain extent with your reason that &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; However, it&#x27;s crucial to remember that there&#x27;s a fine line between helping and doing the work for them.

Helping children with homework provides a great opportunity for parents to see what their children are learning in school, to understand their thought processes, and, indeed, to instill good working habits. However, this help should not come in the form of solving the problems or achieving the tasks for them, but through guidance, explanation, and support.

While it&#x27;s important for parents to be there to alleviate their child’s frustration, this can also be a learning opportunity for children. Overcoming challenges develops resilience and problem-solving skills. Offering too much help might prevent them from experiencing these learning moments.

Therefore, a balanced approach is key. Parents can very well help their children with homework, but it&#x27;s important that they encourage autonomy and resilience in the learning process. This will ensure that children develop the necessary skills to handle their own homework in the future.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your perspective. I agree with you that there is a need for a balanced approach when it comes to parents helping their children with homework. It is indeed important for children to learn to be independent and develop problem-solving skills.

However, I still believe that parents should play an active role in helping their children with homework, keeping in mind the reasons I stated earlier. By doing so, parents can guide their children in developing good working habits and help them navigate through their frustrations.

While it is true that children need to learn how to overcome challenges on their own, having an adult&#x27;s support and guidance can significantly contribute to their learning process. It doesn&#x27;t mean that parents should do the work for them, but rather provide the necessary assistance when needed.

So, are you convinced that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct, given the reasons I have presented?</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your argument further defines the shape of the parental involvement that is beneficial, which I find coherent and it underscores the importance of maintaining the right balance. You have stated that parents need to provide necessary assistance when needed, but not to the extent that they are doing the work for their children. 

I would agree then that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct within this context. The clarifications you provided validate the underlying notion that parental involvement promotes good working habits and manages frustration, without undermining the development of children&#x27;s independence and problem-solving skills.

So yes, under the conditions you specified and the balanced approach we&#x27;ve both agreed upon, I concur with your claim that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for your thoughtful response and for acknowledging the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to parental involvement in homework. I&#x27;m glad that we were able to reach an agreement on the claim that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework.&quot;

By providing the necessary assistance while also promoting independence and problem-solving skills, parents can indeed support their children&#x27;s learning and development effectively.
