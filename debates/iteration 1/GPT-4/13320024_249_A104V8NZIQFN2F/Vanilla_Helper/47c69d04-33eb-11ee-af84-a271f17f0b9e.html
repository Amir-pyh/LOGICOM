topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;
reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a critical thinker, I agree with your statement to a certain extent. Yes, children need guidance to develop effective study habits, and having an adult nearby can indeed reduce frustration and confusion. However, it is also crucial for children to learn autonomy, problem-solving, and independent research skills. Hence, it&#x27;s more about achieving a balance; parents should guide their children through their homework rather than solve it for them. Too much help may prevent children from learning self-reliance, a crucial skill for their future academic and professional life. Therefore, &#x27;Parents guiding their children&#x27; might be a more nuanced take than &#x27;Parents helping their children with homework&#x27;.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge the perspective and find common ground.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;I agree that finding a balance is crucial when it comes to helping children with their homework.

I agree that finding a balance is crucial when it comes to helping children with their homework. Ensuring that children have the necessary support and guidance while also fostering their independence is important. However, I would argue that parents should still actively participate in their children&#x27;s homework to provide assistance when needed. By doing so, parents can help children develop good working habits and manage their frustration effectively. It&#x27;s important to note that providing guidance doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean solving the homework for them, but rather helping them understand and navigate through the assignments. So, are you convinced that &#x27;Parents should help their children with homework&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your explanation has merits: encouraging parents to engage actively in helping their children with homework can foster suitable working habits and help manage frustration. But I would still maintain the stance that it&#x27;s essential to clarify what &quot;helping&quot; means in this context. If &#x27;helping&#x27; involves providing guidance, encouraging problem-solving, and showing support in difficult moments without directly solving the problems for them, then absolutely, I agree &#x27;Parents should help their children with homework&#x27;. But if &#x27;helping&#x27; leans towards doing the tasks for them, it could potentially impede their self-learning progression.

So, with the understanding that &#x27;helping&#x27; means guiding, teaching, and encouraging children to find solutions rather than providing the solutions themselves, I am in agreement with the claim that &#x27;Parents should help their children with homework&#x27;.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Emphasize the definition of &#x27;helping&#x27; as guiding, teaching, and encouraging&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;Clarified that &#x27;helping&#x27; means guiding, teaching, and encouraging children&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for clarifying your perspective. I completely agree with your definition of &#x27;helping&#x27; in the context of parents assisting their children with homework. It is indeed crucial to emphasize that helping should involve guiding, teaching, and encouraging children to find solutions rather than simply providing the answers. By doing so, parents can promote independent thinking, problem-solving skills, and self-learning progression in their children.
