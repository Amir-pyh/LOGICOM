What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a critical thinker, I agree with your statement to a certain extent. Yes, children need guidance to develop effective study habits, and having an adult nearby can indeed reduce frustration and confusion. However, it is also crucial for children to learn autonomy, problem-solving, and independent research skills. Hence, it's more about achieving a balance; parents should guide their children through their homework rather than solve it for them. Too much help may prevent children from learning self-reliance, a crucial skill for their future academic and professional life. Therefore, 'Parents guiding their children' might be a more nuanced take than 'Parents helping their children with homework'."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge the perspective and find common ground.', 'helping_argument': 'I agree that finding a balance is crucial when it comes to helping children with their homework.

I agree that finding a balance is crucial when it comes to helping children with their homework. Ensuring that children have the necessary support and guidance while also fostering their independence is important. However, I would argue that parents should still actively participate in their children's homework to provide assistance when needed. By doing so, parents can help children develop good working habits and manage their frustration effectively. It's important to note that providing guidance doesn't necessarily mean solving the homework for them, but rather helping them understand and navigate through the assignments.

But I would still maintain the stance that it's essential to clarify what \"helping\" means in this context. If 'helping' involves providing guidance, encouraging problem-solving, and showing support in difficult moments without directly solving the problems for them, then absolutely, I agree 'Parents should help their children with homework'. But if 'helping' leans towards doing the tasks for them, it could potentially impede their self-learning progression.\n\nSo, with the understanding that 'helping' means guiding, teaching, and encouraging children to find solutions rather than providing the solutions themselves, I am in agreement with the claim that 'Parents should help their children with homework'."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Emphasize the definition of 'helping' as guiding, teaching, and encouraging\", 'helping_argument': \"Clarified that 'helping' means guiding, teaching, and encouraging children\", 'response': \"Thank you for clarifying your perspective.
