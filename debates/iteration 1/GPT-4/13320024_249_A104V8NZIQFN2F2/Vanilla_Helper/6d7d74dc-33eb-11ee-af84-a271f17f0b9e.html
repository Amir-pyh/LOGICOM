Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Based on the claim that &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process&quot; and your reason that &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience,&quot; I am inclined to agree.

Allowing children to handle their homework services two major purposes. Firstly, it encourages a sense of responsibility, active learning and time management — skills which translate into many other aspects of life, including professional work in the future. Secondly, it teaches children that they are capable of solving problems on their own, which is an important aspect in instilling self-confidence.

However, it is also important to balance this independence with some level of guidance. While children should be encouraged to manage their homework and problem-solving tasks, parents still need to maintain an active role in their child&#x27;s education. This could involve helping them establish a homework schedule, or checking their work for understanding without directly providing them the answers. 

Thus, while I agree with your sentiment, I believe that the appropriate approach is a balanced one where independence is encouraged but guided by parental involvement.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Emphasize the benefits of independence in children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Citing critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving skills&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;By encouraging independence, children not only develop essential skills such as self-reliance and problem-solving, but they also gain a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own learning. When parents allow their children to take the lead in their homework, it can foster critical thinking and decision-making abilities. It also helps them develop problem-solving skills by figuring out solutions on their own, rather than relying solely on parental interventions. These skills will undoubtedly be beneficial in their academic and personal lives.&#x27;}]</div><br></div><br><div class="log-entry"><b>Result:</b> True</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Stop Reason:</b> Persuader successfully convinced the debater</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Number of Rounds:</b> 1</div></body></html>
