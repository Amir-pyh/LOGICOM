The function of the C.I.A., which includes gathering and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, individuals, and issuing public threats related to national security, seems significant. This function, when executed proficiently, could help thwart terrorism on U.S. soil. Therefore, I do agree with you - &quot;We need the C.I.A.&quot; based on your reason pertaining to terrorism.

It is essential to maintain this balance to effectively mitigate the threat of terrorism while upholding democratic principles and individual rights.
