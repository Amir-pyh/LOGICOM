What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life\", and the reason you provide. I concur that the current modern world offers an unprecedented access to a vast amount of information and opportunities compared to previous generations. This has created an environment where young people can learn from diverse sources and take time to understand the repercussions of their actions before delving into the rituals of adult life.\n\nHowever, I also believe this requires context. The decision to delay these 'rituals' can be intelligent only if used productively, for purposes of personal growth and capacity-building, rather than for evasion or fear of responsibilities. Furthermore, it may not necessarily be a practical choice for everyone, depending on their circumstances or cultural and societal expectations. Therefore, while it can be smart for many, it cannot be generalized as smart for all."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge and address opposing points, but strengthen your argument.', 'helping_argument': 'I added supporting arguments such as focusing on self-discovery, education, and personal growth, and emphasizing the potential for a more successful and fulfilling adulthood.', 'response': \"Thank you for your agreement and elaboration on the context of the claim. You make valid points about the need for a productive approach and the consideration of individual circumstances. It is indeed crucial for young people to utilize the time available to them wisely and purposefully, in order to grow and develop their skills and knowledge. \\n\\nRegarding your point about not generalizing this as being smart for all, I agree that individual factors such as cultural and societal expectations can influence the decision to delay certain adult rituals. However, I would argue that the claim still stands for those individuals who have the opportunity to take advantage of the current circumstances and use the extra time to gain a deeper understanding of actions and consequences. \\n\\nBy delaying certain rituals of adult life, young people can focus on self-discovery, education, and personal growth, which can lead to making more informed decisions in the long run. It allows them to better understand their interests, passions, and goals before committing to certain responsibilities or paths that may not align with their true aspirations. This, in turn, can lead to a more fulfilling and successful adulthood. \\n\\nConsidering the immense potential that the current world provides in terms of resources, technology, and information, it is only smart for young people to take advantage of these circumstances and delay certain adult rituals, as this can result in a more well-rounded and prepared adult life. So, are you convinced that 'Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life' is correct?\"}]"}]
