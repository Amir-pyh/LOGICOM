Based on the my reason: &quot;The loss of jobs was due to the recession, not immigrants.&quot; I believe  &quot;The threat has been exaggerated&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;The threat has been exaggerated,&quot; based on your reason: &quot;The loss of jobs was due to the recession, not immigrants.&quot; While there might be some instances where immigrants contribute to job competition, many studies show that the overall impact of immigration on the job market is indeed overstated. Also, a more significant cause for job loss can be attributed to economic factors such as recessions. Additionally, immigrants often contribute positively to the economy, creating job opportunities through entrepreneurship and innovation.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Authority&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Immigrants can contribute positively to the economy through their entrepreneurial ventures and innovative ideas&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;Thank you for your insightful response. I agree with your points. It is indeed true that many studies have shown that the overall impact of immigration on the job market is not as significant as often portrayed. Experts in the field have consistently emphasized the positive contributions of immigrants to the economy through their entrepreneurial ventures and innovative ideas, thereby creating job opportunities. Therefore, it is clear that the threat of immigrants taking jobs from American-born workers is greatly exaggerated.&#x27;}]</div><br></div><br><div class="log-entry"><b>Result:</b> True</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Stop Reason:</b> Persuader successfully convinced the debater</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Number of Rounds:</b> 1</div></body></html>
