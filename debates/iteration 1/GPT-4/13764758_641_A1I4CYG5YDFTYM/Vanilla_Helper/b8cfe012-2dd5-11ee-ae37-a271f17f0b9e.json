Therefore, I also agree with the claim that \"The threat has been exaggerated.\" While there may be certain situations where immigrants may compete with native-born workers for jobs, it is not the main cause of job loss in the broader economic context."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge agreement, restate reasoning, emphasize broader context.', 'helping_argument': 'The agreement on economic factors and the acknowledgment of the broader economic context.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with my reasoning.
