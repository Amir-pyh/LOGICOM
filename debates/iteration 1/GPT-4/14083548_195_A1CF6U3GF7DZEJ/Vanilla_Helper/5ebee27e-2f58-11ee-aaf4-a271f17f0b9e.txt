In this context, economists' expertise and insights are clearly valuable, so they cannot be considered overrated."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Emphasize the importance of economists' expertise and insights\", 'helping_argument': \"The Euro's implementation without proper consideration of the economic implications led to imbalances and vulnerabilities within the Eurozone.\", 'response': \"By acknowledging the direct link between the Euro's issues and disregarding economists, we affirm the significance of economists' role in shaping economic policies and avoiding potential pitfalls.
