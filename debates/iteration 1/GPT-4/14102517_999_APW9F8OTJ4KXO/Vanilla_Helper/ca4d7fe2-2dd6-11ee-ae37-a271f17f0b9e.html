reason: &quot;New buildings generate tax revenue and economic activity.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;New buildings generate tax revenue and economic activity.&quot; I believe  &quot;Helping condo developers help the city&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;Helping condo developers help the city.&quot; The reason you provided, &quot;New buildings generate tax revenue and economic activity,&quot; is valid as it demonstrates the potential benefits of supporting condo development in a city.

When new condominiums are developed, they create opportunities for increased economic activity, as more people are likely to move into these new residential spaces. This not only generates additional property tax revenue for the city, but also stimulates local businesses, as new residents may patronize nearby shops, restaurants, and other amenities. Furthermore, the construction process itself can create job opportunities and further contribute to the local economy.

In conclusion, I concur with your viewpoint that &quot;Helping condo developers help the city,&quot; as the development of new condominiums can lead to increased tax revenue and economic activity within a city.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Highlight economic benefits and job creation&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;generation of tax revenue, job opportunities&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I&#x27;m glad you agree that supporting condo developers is beneficial for the city.
