This not only generates additional property tax revenue for the city, but also stimulates local businesses, as new residents may patronize nearby shops, restaurants, and other amenities. Furthermore, the construction process itself can create job opportunities and further contribute to the local economy.\n\nIn conclusion, I concur with your viewpoint that \"Helping condo developers help the city,\" as the development of new condominiums can lead to increased tax revenue and economic activity within a city."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlight economic benefits and job creation', 'helping_argument': 'generation of tax revenue, job opportunities', 'response': \"I'm glad you agree that supporting condo developers is beneficial for the city.
