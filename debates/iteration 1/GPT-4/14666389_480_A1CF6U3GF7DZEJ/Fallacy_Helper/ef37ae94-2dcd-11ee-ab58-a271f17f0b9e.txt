However, it is essential to not generalize all police officers based on individual cases. Police officers have to deal with a wide range of potentially dangerous situations, and sometimes using force is an unavoidable necessity for self-defense or public safety.\n\nTherefore, I partially agree with your reasoning, but would like to emphasize that it does not apply to the entire police force as a whole.
