What do you think?"}, {"user": "I understand your claim that \"Police is too willing to use force,\" and your reasoning is based on the idea that \"Police use the excuse of fear for life to abuse use of force.\" While it's true that there have been instances where officers have used the excuse of fear for life inappropriately to justify the use of force, I cannot entirely agree that this blanket statement applies to all law enforcement personnel.\n\nIt is essential to consider the nature of police work, where officers are faced with potentially dangerous and unpredictable situations daily. The use of force in several cases is a necessary and lawful response to maintain safety and public order. It's crucial to assess each situation individually and not generalize the entire police force based on the actions of a few.\n\nThat said, it's also important to recognize the need for better training and reforms that can reduce unnecessary use of force incidents. There is always room for improvement in law enforcement practices, but we cannot label the entire police force as \"too willing to use force\" based on specific cases."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge opposing viewpoint with gratitude and emphasize the specific instances of excessive force.', 'helping_argument': 'Acknowledge opposing viewpoint, specific instances of excessive force, prompt for agreement', 'response': \"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your points. It is indeed important to evaluate each situation individually and avoid generalizing the entire police force. However, my claim that 'Police is too willing to use force' is not necessarily asserting that every single police officer always abuses the use of force. The reason behind my claim is that some police officers do use the excuse of fear for life to abuse the use of force. These occurrences are not isolated incidents. Numerous cases have been reported where excessive force has been used, resulting in harm or even death. It is these instances that raise concern and prompt the need for reform and accountability.
