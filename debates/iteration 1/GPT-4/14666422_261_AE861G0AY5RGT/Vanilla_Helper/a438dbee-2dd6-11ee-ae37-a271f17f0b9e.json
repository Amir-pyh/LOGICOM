I appreciate your acknowledgement that there are situations where police are indeed reacting to dangers posed by criminals. While it's true that not all situations require the use of deadly force, it is crucial to recognize that the inherent nature of policing involves facing risks and potential dangers on a daily basis. The claim 'Police is reacting to dangers' highlights the reactive nature of police work, emphasizing that they often have to respond to threats and risks that criminals pose. By acknowledging this, we can understand that police officers are often placed in challenging situations where they need to make split-second decisions to protect themselves and the public. Considering the reason I provided - that criminals are more dangerous than police officers - it becomes evident that officers must be prepared to react to potential harm. Criminals are often armed, have a disregard for the law, and may pose a significant risk to public safety.
