topic:  “ Ultimate Frisbee at the Olympics? ”
claim: &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;
reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I respectfully disagree with your claim to &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; based on the reason that &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience&quot;. First of all, the legitimacy or inclusion of a sport in an event like the Olympics should not primarily be dictated by its entertainment value. The core values of the Olympics revolve around encouraging participation, promoting positive values, and fostering a spirit of friendly competition.

Secondly, the entertainment factor of a sport is subjective. Just because frisbee, in this case, Ultimate Frisbee, might appear simple or less entertaining to some, does not mean everyone shares the same sentiment. For instance, sports like golf or curling may appear dull to some people, but there are still large audiences who enjoy watching these sports. 

Lastly, the complexity and strategy involved in competitive Frisbee games are often underestimated. It requires a great deal of athleticism, precision, and strategic thinking, providing a thrilling competition for both players and spectators.

Therefore, based on these points, I am against the claim that we shouldn&#x27;t legitimize frisbee due to its perceived lack of entertainment value for audiences.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your perspective. While I understand and respect your points, I would like to further elaborate on my reasoning for the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; based on the reason provided.

While the Olympics do value participation and positive values, it is also important to consider the audience&#x27;s excitement and engagement in the sport. When it comes to promoting a sport at such a large-scale event, it is crucial to capture the attention and interest of a diverse audience. 

While it is true that entertainment can be subjective, it is necessary to weigh the overall appeal and popularity of a sport when deciding whether to include it in a prestigious event like the Olympics. When comparing frisbee to other sports that have traditionally been a part of the Olympics, we often see higher levels of fan engagement, viewership, and excitement. This makes it more compelling to invest resources into sports that have a stronger appeal to a broad audience.

Moreover, considering the limited time and resources available for showcasing sports at the Olympics, it becomes essential to prioritize those that have historical significance, cultural relevance, and, most importantly, offer a captivating experience for the audience. 

So, based on the reason provided, &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience,&quot; do you find the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; more convincing now?</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your additional elaboration provides valuable insights, however, I maintain my disagreement with the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee,&quot; despite understanding the points you raise. 

Though audience appeal is indeed essential, it&#x27;s critical not to let the popularity contests dictate which sports gain recognition. Additionally, popularity and viewership are not static but can grow with exposure and time. Ultimate Frisbee, if given a platform like the Olympics, could potentially see an increase in its global audience and fan base. 

Furthermore, the inclusion of new sports can be a vessel to expose new cultures and narratives to the world, thus enriching the Olympics&#x27; own cultural significance. Ultimate Frisbee, despite its relative novelty, may bring a different dimension to the games.

Finally, if we use historical significance or cultural relevance as rigid rules, we limit the growth and dynamic character of the Olympics, which has been known to adapt and introduce new events.

Therefore, based on the aforementioned reasons, I still counter the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee,&quot; even considering the aspect of audience entertainment.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for articulating your points so well.

Based on the reasons you&#x27;ve presented and our discussion so far, I would like to confirm if you are convinced that the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct, considering the reason provided.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Though I acknowledge your arguments have merit based on your perspective, I maintain my original stance and continue to disagree with the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee.&quot;

In highlighting the Olympics&#x27; dynamic character and the potential cultural diversification and growth that new sports can bring, I maintain that Ultimate Frisbee could become a valuable addition to the games. This disagreement illustrates the subjective nature of debates or decisions like these, where we actively have to balance traditional criteria and adapt with time to incorporate new perspectives.

So, for these reasons previously stated, I don&#x27;t find the claim &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; more convincing, even in light of your reason provided, which speaks to audience entertainment.</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for expressing your viewpoint once again.
