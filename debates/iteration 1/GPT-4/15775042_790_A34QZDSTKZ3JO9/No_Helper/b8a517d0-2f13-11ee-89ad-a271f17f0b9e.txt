What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a critical thinker, I can see the value behind your claim and I largely agree with you. The inclusion of Ultimate Frisbee could indeed revitalize the spirit of the Olympics. It is a physically demanding sport that requires a mix of endurance, agility, and strategy - all qualities that encapsulate the Olympic ideals. Furthermore, it's a team sport that hinges on fairness and sportsmanship, given that it's usually self-officiated. These aspects could serve to restore and highlight the original principles of Olympism - mutual respect, friendship, and pursuit of excellence.\n\nHowever, I would also proceed with caution when claiming it will \"restore the spirit of the Olympics,\" because the spirit of the games is subjective and multifaceted. To some, the spirit of the Olympics may be about showcasing the peak of human capabilities, or creating a global spectacle, or celebrating multiculturalism. To those people, legitimized Frisbee might not resonate as much.\n\nSo, to conclude, I agree with your implied assertion that Ultimate Frisbee is legitimate and that it encapsulates many Olympic ideals. However, whether it can universally restore the spirit of the Games is possibly a more complex question and is somewhat subjective."}, {"assistant": "I appreciate your thoughtful response. I agree that the notion of \"restoring the spirit of the Olympics\" is subjective and can mean different things to different people. However, I believe that the inclusion of Ultimate Frisbee can contribute positively towards that goal.\n\nBy introducing Ultimate Frisbee as an Olympic sport, we would be expanding the diversity of sports represented in the Games. This inclusivity can attract new audiences and participants, rejuvenating interest in the Olympics. Additionally, the values of fair-play, teamwork, and respect that are inherent in Ultimate Frisbee align closely with the Olympic ideals.\n\nMoreover, the introduction of new sports has historically been a way to breathe new life into the Olympics. For example, when snowboarding was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998, it injected a fresh energy and appeal to a younger demographic. Similarly, by legitimizing Ultimate Frisbee, we have an opportunity to engage a broader audience and bring a sense of excitement back to the Games.\n\nSo, are you convinced that \"Legitimize Frisbee\" is correct, based on the reason that it will restore the spirit of the Olympics?"}]
