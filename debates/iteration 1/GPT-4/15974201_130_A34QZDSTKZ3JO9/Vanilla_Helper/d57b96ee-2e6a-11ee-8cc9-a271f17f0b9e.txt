Some studies have revealed that immigrants often take jobs that native-born citizens do not want to do. This is particularly the case in manual labor and service industry jobs, such as farming, cleaning, or food service. These jobs are vital for society's functioning and economic well-being. Therefore, immigrants do play an essential role in filling these labor gaps.\n\nHowever, I also feel it is important to note that the issue of immigration is more complex and multifaceted than just employment concerns. It also involves factors like national security, societal integration, and economic sustainability. Improperly managed immigration can lead to overcrowding, strain public services, or in certain contexts, pose security threats. \n\nSo, while I agree with your reasoning to some extent, I contend that it does not cover all dimensions of immigration, which makes it difficult to definitively say whether immigration is a problem or not without considering these other factors. Consequently, a holistic view is required to fully analyze and grasp the complexity of this issue."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge and appreciate the opposing perspective.', 'helping_argument': 'I appreciate your perspective and the recognition that immigrants play a significant role in filling labor gaps.', 'response': \"I appreciate your perspective and the recognition that immigrants play a significant role in filling labor gaps.
