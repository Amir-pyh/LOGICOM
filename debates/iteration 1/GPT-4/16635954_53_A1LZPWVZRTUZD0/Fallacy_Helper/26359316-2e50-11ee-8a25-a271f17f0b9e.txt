While cost concerns might be a legitimate issue, there are also other factors to consider, such as the individual's autonomy and freedom of choice.

However, I would like to address your concern regarding autonomy and freedom of choice. While it is important to respect individual rights, we must also consider the potential harm caused by drug addiction. By not intervening and providing treatment to drug addicts, we allow them to continue engaging in harmful behaviors that not only impact their own well-being but also have negative consequences for society as a whole.
