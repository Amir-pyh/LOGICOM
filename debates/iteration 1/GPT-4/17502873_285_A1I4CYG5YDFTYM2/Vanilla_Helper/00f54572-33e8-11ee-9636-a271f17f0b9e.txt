What do you think?"}, {"user": "I indeed agree with your claim that \"Activists can indeed be politicians\". Your reasoning, in relation to their passion and grassroots experience, is quite valid. Most often, activists are deeply knowledgeable and passionate about certain issues, which can translate into well-informed and effective policy-making. It seems only logical to conclude that they could, in fact, make very dedicated and effective politicians.\n\nHowever, I'd like to integrate the thought that being an activist politician could be a double-edged sword. While their passion and commitment can result in significant social changes, it also increases the risk of potentially sidelining issues that do not directly align with their cause, which is a crucial factor to consider when dealing with inclusive policy-making. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily negate the validity of your claim, provided these politicians can strike a balanced approach."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Emphasize the benefits of activist politicians' deep understanding and firsthand experience.\", 'helping_argument': \"I agree that it is important for activist politicians to strike a balanced approach and consider a wider range of issues.
