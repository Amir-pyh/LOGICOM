What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a debating AI, I'm here to scrutinize the facts and craft an argument, so let's carefully consider your reason. The argument that Mother Teresa didn't administer medicine, specifically aspirin, to the dying, and covertly converted them to Catholicism, is indeed a contentious point.\n\nThe aspect about lack of medical care does call into question her designation as a saint to some extent, especially if the allegations about subpar conditions in her hospices are true. Additionally, the claim about forced or clandestine conversion is problematic if substantiated. Freedom of faith is a fundamental human right, and imposing one's beliefs on others, particularly the vulnerable, is ethically troublesome.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that canonization in the Catholic Church generally revolves around the demonstration of virtuous living, self-sacrifice, and individuals having produced miracles after their death. Canonization is not necessarily a validation of every single action or method applied by the person during their lifetime, but rather an acknowledgment of their holiness and closeness to God - as understood by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn conclusion, then, while your concerns are significant, they may not entirely preclude her canonization within the framework of the Catholic Church. Nonetheless, they invite a larger debate on the aspects that ought to be considered in canonization. The process of canonization, or any form of posthumous reverence, should ideally reflect a critical examination of a candidate's life in its entirety, their deeds, and the method in which such deeds were achieved."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Clearly state the concerns and emphasize the need for critical examination', 'helping_argument': \"I rephrased the user's response to clearly state the concerns about Mother Teresa not providing medical care and covertly converting individuals to Catholicism.

However, I still believe that the concerns regarding Mother Teresa's lack of medical care and covert conversion should be given serious consideration. The allegations raise questions about her commitment to alleviating suffering and respecting others' beliefs. It is essential to critically examine her actions and their impact to ensure that the principles of compassion and respect are upheld in the canonization process.

Both actions you mentioned -- lack of essential medical care and conversion without consent -- conflict with some ethical principles such as respect for individuals' rights and autonomy. If these allegations are proven, they could cast a shadow over the canonization process. \n\nThus, based on your argument, one could agree that there are valid reasons to question the canonization of Mother Teresa. However, this does not strictly imply that the statement 'Mother Teresa should not be canonized' is universally valid, as it might continue to be debated fiercely from various perspectives. Decision regarding canonization ultimately depends on the protocols, standards, and principles of the particular institution conducting the process, in this case, the Catholic Church."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge the AI's statement about the decision-making process resting with the Catholic Church, but emphasize the importance of critically assessing Mother Teresa's actions for canonization.\", 'helping_argument': \"Both actions you mentioned -- lack of essential medical care and conversion without consent -- conflict with some ethical principles such as respect for individuals' rights and autonomy.
