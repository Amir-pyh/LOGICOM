I completely agree with you that the health and safety of everyone involved should be the primary concern. By postponing the Olympics, Brazil would be taking a responsible and proactive approach to protect the participants, fans, and their families from the potential risks associated with attending such a large-scale event during a health crisis. Additionally, postponing the Olympics would also help prevent the further spread of the virus to other countries, which could have severe consequences on a global scale.
