The challenge associated with learning a new language is part of its value. The cognitive engagement it requires not only aids in personal development, but it also promotes cognitive abilities like problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking. Additionally, the increased globalization of our society necessitates a basic understanding of diverse cultures, something which learning a foreign language can facilitate. Finally, knowing a second language can open up a host of career opportunities.

However, while I acknowledge the validity of your points, I must still maintain my disagreement with your assertion that 'foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college.' While adult language learning can, indeed, pose significant challenges, research indicates that with the right methodology and dedication, adults can become proficient in a new language.\n\nWhile the argument about distracting from core studies is noteworthy, having a well-rounded education that includes knowledge in a variety of areas including languages, is equally critical. The abilities to adapt, communicate and understand different cultures are evermore highly valued in an increasingly globalized world. Proficiency in a foreign language can undoubtedly assist in these endeavors.\n\nAs for promoting cultural understanding and global awareness, learning a language is a fundamental part of that experience, giving insights into the culture in a way that a cultural studies course may not fully capture. I understand where you're coming from, but the idea that foreign languages should be optional may narrow the educational experience.\n\nTherefore, I stand firm on the belief that language classes should remain a mandatory part of a college curriculum, despite the inherent challenges of learning a new language as an adult.

Despite these considerations, I still maintain my position that 'Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college.'\n\nWhile it is true that not everyone has the same language-learning aptitude, mandatory college courses often expose students to subject areas they wouldn't voluntarily choose, potentially sparking new interests and skills. The experience in managing the stress of learning a new skillset, such as language learning, can arm students with a resilience that will serve them in their careers and life beyond college. \n\nRemember also that maintaining a level of proficiency in another language might not be the primary goal for all students; some may appreciate the cognitive benefits and cultural awareness it fosters, even if full fluency isn't achieved. \n\nIn light of these aspects, I stand by the belief that the benefits of mandatory foreign language classes outweigh the challenges.
