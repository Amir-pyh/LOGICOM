You make an excellent point about Kate and William's efforts to maintain a typical family dynamic despite their royal status. This is quite significant because it shows that they are able to adapt and embrace modern values and lifestyles. By prioritizing their relationship and family life, they demonstrate that being a royal couple does not necessarily mean they cannot have a modern family.
