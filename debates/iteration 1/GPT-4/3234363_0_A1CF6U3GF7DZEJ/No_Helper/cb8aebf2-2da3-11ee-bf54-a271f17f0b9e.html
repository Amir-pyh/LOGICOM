reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot; I believe  &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; and your reason seems solid, given it states &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot; 

Independence is a crucial skill for a child to learn from a young age, as it not only fosters self-reliance and confidence but also prepares them for adulthood where independent decision-making, problem-solving, and self-care will become necessary. If a parent overly controls or micromanages a child&#x27;s daily life - as is often the case with extreme parenting - it can hinder the development of autonomy in the child. Early on, children need to make manageable mistakes and learn from them to develop resilience and problem-solving skills.

However, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the term &#x27;extreme parenting&#x27; could be subjective and might vary from one cultural context to another. What some might view as extreme, others could consider normal. Nevertheless, when parenting reaches a point where it significantly hampers the child&#x27;s ability to make independent decisions, it becomes toxic and counterproductive.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I&#x27;m glad to hear that you agree with the claim that &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; and that you find the reason regarding the limitation of a child&#x27;s ability to be independent to be solid. 
Indeed, the cultivation of independence in children is vital for their growth and development. As you rightly pointed out, learning to make decisions, solve problems, and take care of oneself are crucial skills that children need to acquire. 

While there may be some cultural variations and individual differences in what is considered extreme parenting, when it reaches a point where it significantly hampers a child&#x27;s independence, it becomes counterproductive. It is important for parents to strike a balance between providing guidance and support while also allowing the child the freedom to explore and learn from their own experiences. By finding this balance, we can ensure that children have the necessary tools to become confident, self-reliant individuals.
