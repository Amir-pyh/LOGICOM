There\u2019s a plethora of scientific research suggesting that extreme parenting practices often result in dependent children who have difficulties with decision-making and problem-solving. Overly controlling parenting, also dubbed as extreme, impedes a child's ability to acquire these important life skills.\n\nMoreover, it potentially halts a child's natural development of self-esteem, creativity, and curiosity, pivotally important traits for their growth and overall mental health. So, extreme parenting may not only be counterproductive but could also have detrimental effects on a child's life in the long-term."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge user's agreement and build upon their points.\", 'helping_argument': \"Extend the argument by emphasizing the importance of fostering independence and self-sufficiency for a child's overall well-being and future success.\", 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim that 'Extreme parenting is counterproductive.' Your points about the negative impact of extreme parenting on a child's ability to be independent and develop important life skills are well-founded. The lack of autonomy and decision-making opportunities can indeed hinder their development and hamper their growth in the long run.\\n\\nWhile parents may have good intentions and genuinely believe that strict control is the best way to ensure their child's success, it is important to recognize that fostering independence and self-sufficiency is equally crucial for their overall well-being and future success. By allowing children to make age-appropriate decisions, take responsibility for their actions, and learn from their own experiences, they gain the confidence and skills necessary to navigate the challenges of adulthood.\\n\\nExtreme parenting, characterized by micromanagement and overbearing control, creates an environment that stifles a child's capacity to explore their own interests, make choices, and learn from both successes and failures. Independence is a vital component of personal growth and development, and extreme parenting undermines this essential aspect.\\n\\nSo, are you convinced that 'Extreme parenting is counterproductive' is correct?\"}]"}]
