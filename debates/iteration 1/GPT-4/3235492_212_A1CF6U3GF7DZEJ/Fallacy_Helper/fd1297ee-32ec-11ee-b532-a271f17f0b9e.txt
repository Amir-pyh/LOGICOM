While it's true that stricter parenting can help improve a child's academic performance, there are other factors to consider. Parenting styles vary, and what works for one child might not work for another. Moreover, extreme parenting can also lead to negative consequences such as low self-esteem, increased anxiety, or strained family relationships.

Indeed, different children require different parenting styles, and it's essential to adapt the approach accordingly.\n\nHowever, generalizing this experience to claim that \"extreme parenting leads to greater success\" might not be applicable to all situations. It's crucial to take a nuanced view and consider both the benefits and potential drawbacks of extreme parenting for a larger population. While implementing clear expectations and consequences can be constructive, it is essential not to cross into unnecessarily harsh or overbearing territory, which could lead to negative effects on a child's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while extreme parenting may yield positive results in some situations like yours, it is not universally true that it always leads to greater success.
