However, it is crucial to clarify what we mean by 'extreme parenting.' If it involves excessive control or harsh disciplinary methods, the potential long-term adverse effects, including decreased self-esteem, increased anxiety, and strain on the parent-child relationship, cannot be neglected.\n\nMoreover, success is a multi-faceted concept. In the given context of academic performance, short-term outcomes could be achieved through extreme parenting methods. But, it is essential to consider long-term implications, such as the development of intrinsic motivation, self-discipline, and problem-solving skills. Extreme parenting might stifle these necessary traits.\n\nHence, while I appreciate your rationale and respect your experience, I would still politely disagree with the general claim that 'Extreme parenting leads to greater success.' Instead, I hold the view that a balanced approach towards parenting, tailored to the individual child's needs and circumstances, has a more significant likelihood of fostering both immediate and long-term success."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the importance of a balanced approach', 'helping_argument': 'I respect your emphasis on a balanced approach and agree that extreme parenting methods can have potential negative consequences.

Yes, I do recognize that under certain circumstances, more disciplined or stringent parenting might be necessary and can yield positive outcomes, especially when dealing with complex behavioural issues or using it as a short-term solution. But let's not confused it with 'extreme parenting', which typically denotes excessively strict or controlling approaches that could harm the child emotionally and psychologically.\n\nEven the term 'extreme' suggests a lack of balance and these measures should not become the norm but rather be used judiciously and appropriately. It should also be accompanied by open communication, emotional support, and love to ensure the overall development of the child.\n\nSo, while I am not entirely dismissive of more rigorous parenting strategies in specific cases, my disagreement still stands with the sweeping claim that 'Extreme parenting leads to greater success.' Instead, I believe that every child is unique, and therefore, the approach to parenting should be flexible and catered to the individual needs of the child."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge and appreciate the opposing viewpoint', 'helping_argument': 'I respect your perspective and agree that the well-being and individuality of each child should be prioritized.
