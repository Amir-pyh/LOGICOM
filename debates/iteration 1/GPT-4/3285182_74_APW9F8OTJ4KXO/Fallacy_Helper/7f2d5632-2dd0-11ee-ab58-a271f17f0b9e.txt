As a result, they may still prioritize cheaper and unhealthier food options that appeal to cost-conscious consumers. Although they offer healthier alternatives, there's no guarantee that consumers will choose them over the cheap, unhealthy options.\n\nMoreover, being a healthier individual is not reliant only on what Wal-Mart offers. It also largely depends on one's personal choices, discipline, and knowledge of health and nutrition.
