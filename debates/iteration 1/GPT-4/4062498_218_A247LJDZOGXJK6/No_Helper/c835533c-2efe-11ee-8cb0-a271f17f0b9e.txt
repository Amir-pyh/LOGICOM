I completely agree with you on the importance of school librarians in ensuring teachers have the necessary resources.\n\nLibrarians have vast knowledge and expertise in curating and selecting educational materials that align with the curriculum. They can identify high-quality resources, recommend books, articles, and other materials that are relevant and engaging for students. By collaborating with teachers, librarians can support them in delivering effective lessons and providing students with a comprehensive learning experience.\n\nFurthermore, librarians can assist in research and information literacy skills development, teaching students how to evaluate and use information effectively. These skills are crucial in today's information-driven world, where the ability to critically analyze and navigate through various sources of information is essential.\n\nSo, based on these reasons and the role librarians play in ensuring teachers have the necessary resources, I'm glad we both agree that \"School librarians are not expendable.\""}]
