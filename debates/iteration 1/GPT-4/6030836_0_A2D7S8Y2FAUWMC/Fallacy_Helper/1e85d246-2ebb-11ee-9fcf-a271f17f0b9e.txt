Tax breaks should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the institution's overall contribution to the society, commitment to social equity, and their financial transparency.

Instead, we should evaluate each wealthy college on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not they deserve tax breaks. \n\nIt is crucial to assess factors such as the proportion of students receiving financial aid, a college's commitment to research and community development, and their efforts to maintain a diverse and inclusive campus environment. If the majority of wealthy colleges commit to initiatives like Columbia College's example, then the argument for tax breaks would be more persuasive.
