What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with you that &quot;We need more advice about eating well&quot; based on your reason: &quot;Some kids are not taught by parents how to cook, and many schools have done away with home economics in favor of science and math.&quot;

Relying solely on parents to teach their children about proper nutrition and cooking can lead to gaps in knowledge, especially if the parents themselves are not well-informed on the subject. The education system plays a crucial role in filling in those gaps, and by removing home economics classes, many students are left without access to vital information on how to eat well and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Therefore, providing more advice about eating well through various channels, such as schools, public health campaigns, and even social media, is essential to ensure that everyone has access to accurate, helpful, and easily understandable information on nutrition and cooking.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Popular Opinion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;By relying solely on parents to teach their children about nutrition and cooking, we are running the risk of leaving gaps in knowledge.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;Many people believe that relying solely on parents to teach their children about nutrition and cooking leads to gaps in knowledge.
