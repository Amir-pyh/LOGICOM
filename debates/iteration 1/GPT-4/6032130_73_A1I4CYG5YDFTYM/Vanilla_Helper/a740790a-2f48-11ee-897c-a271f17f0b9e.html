Based on the my reason: &quot;Some kids are not taught by parents how to cook, and many schools have done away with home economics in favor of science and math.&quot; I believe  &quot;We need more advice about eating well&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;We need more advice about eating well&quot; based on your reason. If some kids are not taught by their parents how to cook, and many schools have eliminated home economics courses in favor of science and math, it creates a knowledge gap in essential life skills such as cooking healthy meals. This could lead to poor dietary choices and health complications in the long run. Providing more advice, education, and resources about eating well can help fill this gap and lead to healthier lifestyles for these individuals.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Address the knowledge gap caused by lack of cooking education&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;By addressing the knowledge gap created by the lack of cooking education at home and in schools, we can empower individuals, especially children and young adults, to make healthier choices when it comes to their diet.
