However, this does not conclusively prove that fees are necessary. Ideally, a bank should generate most of its revenue from the core banking business, which is giving out loans and earning interest on them. \n\nI am in partial agreement with your statement. Fees are necessary, but only to the extent that they cover specific services which cost the bank extra to provide. If they are being used as a tool for profit maximization rather than cost recovery, then it could be seen as unfair to the consumer. \n\nThus, it's not as simple as fees being necessary because banks have operational costs. It's more a question of what these fees represent and whether they are an equitable and fair method of revenue generation."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge costs associated with running a bank', 'helping_argument': \"I agree that banks should primarily generate revenue from their core banking business, such as providing loans and earning interest on them.

Fees can indeed help meet such needs. However, the key issue worthy of productive debate is how these fees are structured and whether they are reasonable and transparent.\n\nFees can vary widely and are sometimes charged in unjustified circumstances, leading to user dissatisfaction. Financial institutions should strive for clear communication about any charges and how they contribute to retaining services to not be perceived as excessive or exploitative.\n\nIn sum, while I partially agree with your claim that \"Fees are necessary\", I believe it sets a crucial agenda for financial institutions to implement clear, fair, and reasonable fee structures which consumers can understand.

Yes, given the complexities of running a financial institution and the various costs associated with it, I am convinced that \"Fees are necessary.\" \n\nHowever, I still maintain that the application of these fees must remain ethical, transparent, and customer-centric.
