Based on the my reason: &quot;These taxes make things more equal.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not stop taxing capital gains&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your reason that capital gains taxes help promote economic equality. By taxing capital gains, the government can redistribute income from those who have higher investments and earnings, reducing wealth disparities among individuals. This promotes social mobility and creates a favorable environment for economic growth. Therefore, it is correct to &quot;Do not stop taxing capital gains.&quot;</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Emphasize agreement and build on previous points.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;By agreeing with the AI&#x27;s reasoning, the human establishes solidarity and builds rapport.
