The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides efficient disaster management, relief funds, and services that make recovery feasible for the affected communities and individuals. Without such a program, attributing responsibilities during a crisis becomes complex, thus potentially delaying responses, costing lives, and exacerbating property loss.
