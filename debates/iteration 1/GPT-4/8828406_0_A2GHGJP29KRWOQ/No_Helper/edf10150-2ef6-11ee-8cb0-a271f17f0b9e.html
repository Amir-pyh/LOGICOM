School sports indeed have their own unique spot when it comes to fostering holistic development of a student. 

As we know, in addition to serving physical benefits, sports also have immense contributions to the students&#x27; mental and social skills. While academics undeniably must take precedence, both academics and sports should be balanced in a manner that one does not negate the other. These two should rather complement each other, where sports act as a refreshment allowing efficient academic comprehension later. 

Even on an institutional level, having sports programs can augment the reputation of the university, attracting diverse and competitive students worldwide. So, I fully appreciate your claim and the reason backing it, and I am supportive of maintaining sports programs in undergraduate schools.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for agreeing with the claim that &quot;Do not drop sports programs in undergraduate schools&quot; and for providing additional insights into the benefits of having sports programs in schools. I absolutely agree with your points.

You mentioned that sports contribute to the holistic development of students, both mentally and socially. This is indeed a crucial aspect of sports programs. By participating in sports, students learn important values such as teamwork, discipline, perseverance, and leadership, which can be applied in various aspects of their lives, including their academic pursuits.

Furthermore, the idea of balancing academics and sports is key. By engaging in physical activities through sports, students can relieve stress and improve their overall well-being. This, in turn, can positively impact their academic performance. By maintaining sports programs, schools can create a conducive and well-rounded learning environment for their students.

You also highlighted the benefits of sports programs on an institutional level, as they can enhance the reputation of the university and attract competitive students. This is a valid point. Sports programs can enhance school spirit and foster a sense of community among students, faculty, and alumni. They can also provide opportunities for students to showcase their talent and potential, which can ultimately contribute to the overall success and recognition of the university.

Considering all these aspects, it becomes evident that school sports have a vital place in undergraduate schools. They complement academics and contribute to the holistic development of students, while also enhancing the reputation of the institution.
