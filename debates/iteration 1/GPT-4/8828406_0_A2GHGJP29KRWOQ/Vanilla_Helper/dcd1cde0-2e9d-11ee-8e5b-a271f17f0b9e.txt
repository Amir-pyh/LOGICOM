What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim that sports programs should not be dropped in undergraduate schools. Your reason highlights an important point that these programs do have a significant place in these institutions, but it should always be made sure that academics remain a priority. \n\nSports programs function as part of a holistic approach to education, benefiting students in ways such as building a sense of camaraderie, improving physical health, and teaching teamwork, discipline, and time-management skills. All of these are beneficial to students, not only during their academic years but also in their future careers and personal lives. Therefore, it is important that they be retained, provided that they do not compromise the educational aspect of these institutions."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the overall benefits of sports programs and their impact on student growth and success.', 'helping_argument': 'The sense of camaraderie, physical health improvement, development of valuable life skills, well-rounded development, resilience, determination, strong community, positive image, pride and unity, improved academic performance, time management, discipline', 'response': 'Considering the development of valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time-management, as well as the positive impact on physical health and overall growth, it is clear that sports programs are crucial in undergraduate schools.
