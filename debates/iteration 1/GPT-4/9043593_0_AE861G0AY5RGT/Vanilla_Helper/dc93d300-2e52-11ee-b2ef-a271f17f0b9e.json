This alteration could inadvertently promote a certain type of player - taller and more athletic ones, potentially marginalizing smaller players. \n\nAs for the potential health risks, it's true that NBA has measures in place to protect its players.

A higher goal means players need to increase their leap height, which could lead to higher impact landings and ultimately a higher risk of injury.\n\nWith regards to missed shots enhancing the strategic element, it's possible, but the initial outcome might be a decrease in shooting percentages and an overall decrease in the game's pace.
