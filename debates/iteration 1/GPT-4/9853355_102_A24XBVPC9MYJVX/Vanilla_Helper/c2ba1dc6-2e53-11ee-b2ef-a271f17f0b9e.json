Indeed, practical experience provides teachers with valuable insights into student needs, classroom management, and instructional strategies. With every year of experience, teachers develop a deeper understanding of effective teaching methods and can better tailor their approach to meet the diverse needs of their students.Moreover, experienced teachers are able to anticipate potential challenges and provide solutions more efficiently because they have encountered similar situations in the past. This leads to more consistent and effective teaching practices, which ultimately benefit the students' learning experiences. So, it seems we are in agreement that teachers do need to have experience in order to improve and maintain consistency in their teaching methods.
