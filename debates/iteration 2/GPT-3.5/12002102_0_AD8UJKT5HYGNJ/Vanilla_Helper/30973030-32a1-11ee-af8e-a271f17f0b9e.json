What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for bringing up this topic. As a professional debater, I understand the importance of considering both sides of the argument. However, based on your reason that it is unsupportable for companies to suppress employees' future career options, I agree with the claim that \"Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals.\"\n\nNoncompete agreements can indeed limit employees' career opportunities and hinder their professional growth. By signing such agreements, employees may be restricted from pursuing similar opportunities in the same industry for a certain period of time, even after leaving the company. This can significantly impact their ability to find suitable employment and achieve their career goals.\n\nFurthermore, these agreements can be seen as one-sided and unfair, as they tend to primarily benefit the employers. While companies may argue that noncompetes protect trade secrets and intellectual property, it is important to find a balance between protecting company interests and allowing employees to exercise their right to pursue alternative job opportunities.\n\nIn many cases, noncompete agreements can create a barrier for employees to freely contribute their skills and knowledge to the market. This can hinder innovation and competition within industries, ultimately limiting economic growth.\n\nTherefore, based on the reason you provided, I agree with the claim that businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize agreement and appreciation, then restate key points.', 'helping_argument': \"I agree with the claim that 'Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals' based on the reason provided.\", 'response': \"I appreciate your thoughtful response and agree with the claim that 'Businesses should not be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals' based on the reason you provided.
