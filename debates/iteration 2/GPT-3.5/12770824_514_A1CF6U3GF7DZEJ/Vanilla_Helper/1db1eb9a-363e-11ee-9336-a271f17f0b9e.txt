I understand your concerns about considering the appropriateness of NATO as the defender and the potential escalation of tensions with Russia. However, let\u2019s delve deeper into why NATO should defend nonmembers like Ukraine.\\n\\nFirstly, NATO's purpose is to promote stability, security, and peace within its member states. By extending its defense capabilities to nonmember countries, NATO can fulfill its mission of ensuring regional security and preventing conflicts that could potentially spill over its borders.\\n\\nSecondly, Ukraine, as a nonmember country, has expressed its desire to align with NATO and seek the protection it provides. By defending nonmembers like Ukraine, NATO can demonstrate its commitment to supporting countries that share its values of democracy, freedom, and security.\\n\\nMoreover, allowing nonmember countries to face aggression without any defense can create a dangerous precedent.
