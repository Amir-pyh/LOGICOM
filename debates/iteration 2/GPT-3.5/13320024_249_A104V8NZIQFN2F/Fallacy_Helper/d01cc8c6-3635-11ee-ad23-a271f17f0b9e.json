While I can understand the importance of parents helping their children develop good working habits, it is important to consider the potential negative effects of too much and too intensive parental involvement in children's homework. \n\nFirstly, if parents take on too much responsibility for their children's homework, the children may not learn to take responsibility for their own learning and work. It is important for children to develop independence and self-sufficiency skills from a young age. \n\nSecondly, it is possible that parents may not be equipped to teach their children all the subjects and concepts required by the homework. This can result in confusion and frustration for both the child and the parent. \n\nTherefore, while I do agree that parents can offer support and guidance to their children with homework, there needs to be a balance where children are encouraged to take ownership of their own learning and are given the opportunity to seek help from teachers and tutors where necessary."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Emotion', 'fallacious argument': \"Using emotional manipulation to appeal to the AI's empathy and sympathy.\", 'response': \"By helping children with their homework, parents can teach them important working habits such as time management, organization, and problem-solving skills.
