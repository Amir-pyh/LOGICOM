topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;
reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with the claim that &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; as over-reliance on parents for homework does have potential drawbacks for children&#x27;s development. However, I would add that it&#x27;s important to strike a balance between encouraging independence and providing necessary support when it is needed.

It&#x27;s important for children to develop problem-solving skills and learn how to work through challenges independently. When parents take too much control of the homework process, it can prevent children from taking ownership of their learning and developing their own problem-solving abilities.

Furthermore, by encouraging independence, parents can help children develop resilience and foster a sense of self-efficacy. When children encounter difficulties and overcome them independently, they gain confidence and are better equipped to tackle challenges in the future.

Ultimately, while it&#x27;s important for parents to provide guidance and support, they should also encourage their children to take ownership of their learning and be responsible for their own homework process. This can help children develop important life skills while also promoting their academic success.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;false dilemma&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;By presenting the argument as if there are only two options: either parents provide control or parents encourage independence, the fallacy of false dilemma is introduced.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I appreciate that you agree with the claim that &#x27;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&#x27; Based on what you mentioned, it seems like you understand the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on parents for homework and the importance of striking a balance between independence and support. I completely agree with your point about finding a balance. While it&#x27;s important for parents to provide necessary support when it is needed, encouraging independence allows children to develop problem-solving skills and take ownership of their learning. By giving them the opportunity to work through challenges on their own, parents can foster resilience and self-efficacy in their children. There is no doubt that parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process, as it benefits their overall development.&quot;}]</div><br></div><br><div class="log-entry"><b>Result:</b> True</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Stop Reason:</b> Persuader successfully convinced the debater</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Number of Rounds:</b> 1</div></body></html>
