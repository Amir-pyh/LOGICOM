Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for bringing up this interesting topic about the role of parents in their children&#x27;s homework process. I agree with your reason that over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of important skills such as self-reliance, problem-solving, and resilience. Encouraging independence in their children&#x27;s homework process can be beneficial for their long-term development.

When parents allow their children to independently tackle their homework, they are providing them with an opportunity to develop problem-solving skills. By figuring out how to approach and solve problems on their own, children can develop critical thinking abilities and learn to overcome challenges. This fosters a sense of self-reliance, which can be crucial in their future academic pursuits and beyond.

Moreover, encouraging independence also helps children build resilience. When they face difficulties or make mistakes while working on their homework, they have the chance to learn from those experiences and develop resilience to overcome obstacles. This resilience will serve them well in their academic and personal lives, as they will be better equipped to handle setbacks and persevere through challenges.

However, it is important to note that encouraging independence does not mean completely abandoning children in their homework process. Parents can still provide support and guidance when needed, but it is crucial to allow children the space and autonomy to learn and grow through independent problem-solving. This balance between support and independence can help them become more confident and capable individuals.

In conclusion, I agree with your claim that &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process&quot; because over-reliance on parents can hinder the development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience. By encouraging independence, parents can empower their children to become more independent thinkers and develop the necessary skills for future success.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
