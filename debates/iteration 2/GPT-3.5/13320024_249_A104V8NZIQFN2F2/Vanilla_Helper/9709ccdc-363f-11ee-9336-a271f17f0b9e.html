Over-reliance on parents for homework can certainly prevent a child from developing problem-solving skills, resilience, and self-reliance. However, I also believe that parental involvement in a child&#x27;s homework process is important to a certain extent. It is essential to ensure that the child is on the correct path, to offer guidance and support, and to monitor their progress.

By allowing children to take ownership of their homework, they can develop critical thinking skills, learn to solve problems on their own, and build resilience in the face of challenges.
