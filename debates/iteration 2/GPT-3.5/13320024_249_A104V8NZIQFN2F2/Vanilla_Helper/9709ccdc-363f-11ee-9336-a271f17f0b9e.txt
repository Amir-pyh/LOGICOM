Over-reliance on parents for homework can certainly prevent a child from developing problem-solving skills, resilience, and self-reliance. However, I also believe that parental involvement in a child's homework process is important to a certain extent. It is essential to ensure that the child is on the correct path, to offer guidance and support, and to monitor their progress. It's all about finding a balance between being involved enough without doing too much for them.
