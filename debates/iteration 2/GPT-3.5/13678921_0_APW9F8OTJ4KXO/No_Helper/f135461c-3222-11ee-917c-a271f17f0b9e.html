The current world indeed offers young people numerous opportunities to delay the traditional milestones of adulthood, such as getting married, having children, or settling into stable careers. This delay can provide them with more time and freedom to explore their own interests, gain experiences, and understand the consequences of their actions. By taking advantage of these circumstances, young people can make informed decisions about their future and ensure that they are better equipped for the responsibilities that come with adulthood.

Moreover, delaying these rituals can also lead to personal growth and self-discovery. Young people have the opportunity to focus on their education, personal development, and establishing a strong foundation before taking on the commitments associated with adulthood. This can result in a more fulfilled and well-rounded individual who is better prepared to navigate the challenges of adult life.

However, while there are certainly benefits to delaying the rituals of adult life, it is important for young people to strike a balance. It is crucial not to postpone these milestones indefinitely or without purpose. Society still relies on individuals to contribute to the workforce, form stable relationships, and ensure continuity. Therefore, it is essential for young people to actively plan for their future and consider the long-term implications of their choices.
