After carefully analyzing your reason, I agree with the statement that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life.\" \n\nThe current world indeed offers young people numerous opportunities to delay the traditional milestones of adulthood, such as getting married, having children, or settling into stable careers. This delay can provide them with more time and freedom to explore their own interests, gain experiences, and understand the consequences of their actions. By taking advantage of these circumstances, young people can make informed decisions about their future and ensure that they are better equipped for the responsibilities that come with adulthood.\n\nMoreover, delaying these rituals can also lead to personal growth and self-discovery.

This can result in a more fulfilled and well-rounded individual who is better prepared to navigate the challenges of adult life.\n\nHowever, while there are certainly benefits to delaying the rituals of adult life, it is important for young people to strike a balance. It is crucial not to postpone these milestones indefinitely or without purpose. Society still relies on individuals to contribute to the workforce, form stable relationships, and ensure continuity.
