The imposition of a common currency with varying economic situations across countries by disregarding important economic indicators and advice ultimately led to significant economic instability.\n\nThough the creation of the Euro had noble intentions of fostering economic integration and stability, its implementation without heeding economists' advice and considerations has had severe consequences. This demonstrates why economists should not be seen as overrated, as they possess the crucial knowledge and expertise necessary for informed decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with your claim that \"Economists are not overrated\" based on the reason you provided regarding the Euro being a direct result of countries ignoring economists. The Eurozone crisis serves as a clear illustration of the importance of economists' guidance and the potential repercussions of overlooking their recommendations."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge agreement and build on it.', 'helping_argument': \"By acknowledging the role that economists play in providing guidance and analysis, we acknowledge the value they bring to the table.
