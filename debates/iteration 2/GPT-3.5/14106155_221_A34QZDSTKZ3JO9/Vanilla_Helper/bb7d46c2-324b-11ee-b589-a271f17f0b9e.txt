This can involve implementing regulations, ensuring community engagement, and promoting the use of inclusive and affordable housing policies. \n\nTherefore, while I understand the concerns about negative consequences associated with some condo development projects, I believe it is important to consider a more nuanced view that takes into account the specific circumstances and strives for balanced and responsible development practices."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge perspective, reiterate reason with emphasis, and seek agreement.', 'helping_argument': 'Acknowledging the complexities and importance of responsible practices in condo development.', 'response': \"Indeed, it's crucial to consider the specific circumstances and advocate for responsible development practices.
