Based on the my reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your argument. It is important to approach this topic with an open mind and critically analyze the reasons provided.

Regarding the reason presented that there isn&#x27;t enough in Ultimate Frisbee to entertain an audience, I would respectfully disagree with this point. Ultimate Frisbee as a sport has experienced significant growth in popularity and has gained a dedicated following. The sport features dynamic plays, high-speed actions, and strategic gameplay, which can be engaging for both players and spectators alike.

Furthermore, Frisbee-based sports have demonstrated their ability to captivate audiences through events such as the World Ultimate Club Championships and the Ultimate Frisbee World Championships. These tournaments attract large crowds and showcase the physical athleticism and skill involved in the sport.

Additionally, introducing Ultimate Frisbee as an Olympic sport can contribute to the diversification of the games, offering a unique and accessible avenue for athletes to participate in a global sporting event. The inclusiveness of Ultimate Frisbee, which allows for mixed-gender teams, also aligns with the values of equality and inclusivity that the Olympics stand for.

In conclusion, based on the reasons provided, I respectfully disagree with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee. The sport has the potential to entertain audiences, has gained a dedicated following, and offers the opportunity for athletes to compete at the global level.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Emphasize the lack of appeal and entertainment value for the audience&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Frisbee may not have the same level of appeal or excitement&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;While I understand that Ultimate Frisbee has gained popularity and has its dedicated following, I still maintain my stance that we should not legitimize Frisbee based on the given reason. Frisbee-based sports, including Ultimate Frisbee, may not have the same level of appeal or excitement that traditional sports like soccer or basketball have. The lack of physical contact and intensity in Frisbee can make it less appealing to a wider audience. Furthermore, when it comes to international events like the Olympics, it is crucial to prioritize sports that have a long history, broad appeal, and a legacy of captivating global audiences. Introducing Frisbee as an Olympic sport may divert attention and resources from more established and widely recognized sports. In conclusion, while Ultimate Frisbee may have its merits as a recreational activity, it may not have enough substance or entertainment value to justify its legitimization as a mainstream sport.

I appreciate your perspective and the reasons you provided.

However, upon careful consideration, I respectfully disagree with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee. While it is true that Frisbee-based sports may not have the same level of mainstream appeal as established sports like soccer or basketball, it is important to consider the potential for growth and evolution in the sporting world.

Every sport has its unique characteristics and attractions. Just as some may find excitement in the physicality and intensity of contact sports, others may appreciate the agility, strategy, and precision that Frisbee-based sports require. Diversifying the Olympic program with sports that offer different experiences and challenges can help to attract new audiences and inspire athletes with different skills and interests to participate.

Moreover, the inclusion of Frisbee-based sports in the Olympics would provide an opportunity to showcase the international talent and competitive spirit within these sports. It could also encourage more widespread participation and development of the sport in countries that may not have traditionally prioritized it.

In conclusion, while I understand and respect your perspective, I believe that legitimizing Frisbee-based sports, such as Ultimate Frisbee, would promote inclusivity, broaden the range of sports represented in the Olympics, and offer new opportunities for athletes and audiences alike.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Prioritize sports with wider appeal and a longstanding history.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Introducing Frisbee-based sports as an Olympic sport might not provide the necessary level of excitement or entertainment value that spectators expect from such a prestigious event.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I maintain my stance that we should not legitimize Frisbee based on the given reason. It is important to prioritize sports that have a wider appeal and a longstanding history of captivating global audiences, especially when it comes to events like the Olympics.

While I understand your emphasis on prioritizing sports with a wider appeal and longstanding history, I must respectfully maintain my disagreement with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee.

Inclusion in the Olympics is not solely based on the level of excitement or entertainment value a sport provides, but also on factors such as global participation, governance, and adherence to Olympic values of fair play and equality. Frisbee-based sports, including Ultimate Frisbee, have demonstrated growth in participation worldwide and have established international governing bodies.

The Olympic Games have a history of evolving and adapting to reflect the changing landscape of sports and interests of athletes and audiences. By embracing new and emerging sports, the Olympics can stay relevant and attract diverse athletes and spectators. The addition of Frisbee-based sports can contribute to this evolution and broader representation of athletic talents.

Furthermore, the argument that introducing Frisbee-based sports might divert attention and resources from more established sports can be addressed through sound management and strategic planning by sports organizations and Olympic committees. The addition of new sports can create opportunities for growth and inspire participation in various communities, without necessarily diminishing the attention given to other sports.

In conclusion, while I understand your perspective, I disagree with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee. I believe that the inclusion of Frisbee-based sports in the Olympic program can contribute to the diversity, inclusivity, and evolution of the Games without undermining the prominence of more established sports.</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Acknowledge the opponent&#x27;s perspective but stand firm on your position.&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;I appreciate your perspective and the points you have raised. However, I still stand by my position that we should not legitimize Frisbee based on the given reason.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;While it is true that the Olympics have evolved over time and adapted to include new sports, it is important to carefully consider the overall impact and relevance of introducing Frisbee-based sports to the Olympic program. The Olympics represent the pinnacle of athletic achievement and provide a platform for sports that have a broad global following and capture the imagination of spectators. Frisbee-based sports, while enjoyable for participants, may not have the same level of depth or complexity as traditional Olympic sports. The limited skill set required and the subjective nature of scoring and officiating in some Frisbee-based sports may not provide the necessary level of objectivity and competitiveness for an Olympic event. Moreover, the limited popularity and commercial appeal of Frisbee-based sports compared to other established sports may result in lower viewership and reduced interest from sponsors and broadcasters. This can impact the overall financial viability and sustainability of Frisbee-based sports as an Olympic endeavor. In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential for growth and inclusion that Frisbee-based sports may bring, I maintain my belief that we should not legitimize Frisbee in the context of the Olympics.

I understand your concerns regarding the depth, objectivity, and commercial appeal of Frisbee-based sports in the Olympic context.

Upon revisiting the discussion, I remain unconvinced that &#x27;Do not legitimize Frisbee&#x27; is the correct stance. While Frisbee-based sports may not have the same level of complexity or objective scoring systems as some traditional Olympic sports, they still require skill, strategy, and athleticism from participants. The subjective nature of scoring can also be found in various existing Olympic sports.

Furthermore, the Olympics have a history of including sports that cater to diverse interests and skill sets. The Games aim to celebrate the spirit of sport and provide a platform for athletes from various disciplines to compete at the highest level. By embracing new sports, such as Frisbee-based sports, the Olympics can promote inclusivity and provide opportunities for athletes who may not fit the traditional mold of Olympic sports.

While the commercial appeal and viewership can be important considerations, I believe that the introduction of Frisbee-based sports can attract new audiences and sponsors who appreciate the uniqueness and excitement that these sports offer. Like any sport, the promotion and marketing efforts can play a significant role in generating interest and support.

In conclusion, I understand and respect your concerns, but based on the arguments presented and the values of inclusivity and diversity within the Olympic context, I disagree with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee.</div><br><div class="round-number">5.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge the opposing viewpoint and appreciate the discussion.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;The limited depth, objectivity, and commercial appeal of Frisbee-based sports, when compared to traditional Olympic sports&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;Thank you for considering my arguments and engaging in this debate.
