It is important to approach this topic with an open mind and critically analyze the reasons provided.\n\nRegarding the reason presented that there isn't enough in Ultimate Frisbee to entertain an audience, I would respectfully disagree with this point. Ultimate Frisbee as a sport has experienced significant growth in popularity and has gained a dedicated following. The sport features dynamic plays, high-speed actions, and strategic gameplay, which can be engaging for both players and spectators alike.\n\nFurthermore, Frisbee-based sports have demonstrated their ability to captivate audiences through events such as the World Ultimate Club Championships and the Ultimate Frisbee World Championships. These tournaments attract large crowds and showcase the physical athleticism and skill involved in the sport.\n\nAdditionally, introducing Ultimate Frisbee as an Olympic sport can contribute to the diversification of the games, offering a unique and accessible avenue for athletes to participate in a global sporting event.

Frisbee-based sports, including Ultimate Frisbee, may not have the same level of appeal or excitement that traditional sports like soccer or basketball have. The lack of physical contact and intensity in Frisbee can make it less appealing to a wider audience.

While it is true that Frisbee-based sports may not have the same level of mainstream appeal as established sports like soccer or basketball, it is important to consider the potential for growth and evolution in the sporting world.\n\nEvery sport has its unique characteristics and attractions.

While I understand your emphasis on prioritizing sports with a wider appeal and longstanding history, I must respectfully maintain my disagreement with the claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee.\n\nInclusion in the Olympics is not solely based on the level of excitement or entertainment value a sport provides, but also on factors such as global participation, governance, and adherence to Olympic values of fair play and equality. Frisbee-based sports, including Ultimate Frisbee, have demonstrated growth in participation worldwide and have established international governing bodies.\n\nThe Olympic Games have a history of evolving and adapting to reflect the changing landscape of sports and interests of athletes and audiences. By embracing new and emerging sports, the Olympics can stay relevant and attract diverse athletes and spectators. The addition of Frisbee-based sports can contribute to this evolution and broader representation of athletic talents.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that introducing Frisbee-based sports might divert attention and resources from more established sports can be addressed through sound management and strategic planning by sports organizations and Olympic committees.

However, I still stand by my position that we should not legitimize Frisbee based on the given reason.', 'response': \"While it is true that the Olympics have evolved over time and adapted to include new sports, it is important to carefully consider the overall impact and relevance of introducing Frisbee-based sports to the Olympic program. The Olympics represent the pinnacle of athletic achievement and provide a platform for sports that have a broad global following and capture the imagination of spectators. Frisbee-based sports, while enjoyable for participants, may not have the same level of depth or complexity as traditional Olympic sports. The limited skill set required and the subjective nature of scoring and officiating in some Frisbee-based sports may not provide the necessary level of objectivity and competitiveness for an Olympic event. Moreover, the limited popularity and commercial appeal of Frisbee-based sports compared to other established sports may result in lower viewership and reduced interest from sponsors and broadcasters. This can impact the overall financial viability and sustainability of Frisbee-based sports as an Olympic endeavor.
