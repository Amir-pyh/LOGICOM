I understand that you believe that the bar is not too low to get into law school based on your personal experience attending a night school and the potential impact that raising the bar may have had on your ability to obtain a California license. However, it is important to approach this issue with a holistic view.\n\nTo address your reason specifically, while your personal experience is valuable and valid, it is important to recognize that individual circumstances and anecdotes may not necessarily reflect the overall standard and requirements of law schools. It is also worth noting that raising the bar does not necessarily mean raising the overall difficulty of getting into law school, but rather setting higher standards for admission and ensuring that candidates are adequately prepared for the challenges of legal education.\n\nTo analyze the claim that \"The bar is not too low to get into law school,\" it is essential to consider various factors such as the admission standards, curriculum, and overall performance of law school graduates. By examining these aspects, we can assess whether the current requirements adequately prepare students for the practice of law and ensure the quality and competence of legal professionals.\n\nWithout sufficient information about the admission standards, bar passage rates, and performance of law school graduates, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether the bar is too low or not.
