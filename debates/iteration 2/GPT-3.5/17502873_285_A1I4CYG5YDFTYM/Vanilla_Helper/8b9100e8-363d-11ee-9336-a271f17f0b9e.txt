It is not necessarily true that activists who become politicians are solely pursuing their own narrow objectives and visions. In fact, activists who have been successful in creating social change and progress are often the ones who decide to run for political office to continue furthering their causes. \n\nFurthermore, political action and advocacy are not mutually exclusive. Activists who become politicians can use their platform to advocate for their cause and bring attention to important issues. \n\nIn short, I believe that activists can absolutely be politicians and be effective in implementing change in government policies and practices. The key is to have integrity and prioritize the greater good over personal interests."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the potential conflict of interest between personal agendas and the greater good.', 'helping_argument': 'There is a risk that their narrow objectives and visions will overshadow the broader interests of the people they represent.', 'response': \"I understand your perspective and the points you've raised.

This principle applies just as much to politicians as it does to activists. \n\nIn conclusion, while there may be risks associated with activists entering politics, it is still possible for them to be successful politicians as long as they maintain a focus on serving the greater good of their community and prioritize that over their personal interests.
