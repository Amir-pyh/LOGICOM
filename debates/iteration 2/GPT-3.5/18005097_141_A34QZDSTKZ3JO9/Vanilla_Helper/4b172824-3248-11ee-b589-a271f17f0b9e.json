Based on your reason that \"Mother Teresa was active and made a difference in the city,\" I can understand why you believe she should be canonized. However, please note that a critical analysis requires considering multiple perspectives and examining different aspects of the argument.\n\nWhile it is true that Mother Teresa dedicated her life to serving others and made a positive impact on the lives of many people, the question of whether she should be canonized involves a more complex evaluation. Canonization is the process through which the Catholic Church recognizes an individual as a saint, indicating that they lived a life of exemplary holiness and are worthy of veneration.\n\nTo determine whether or not someone should be canonized, it is important to consider the criteria established by the Catholic Church for sainthood. This includes the demonstration of heroic virtue, miracles attributed to the candidate's intercession, and widespread devotion among the faithful.\n\nIn the case of Mother Teresa, it is true that she was highly regarded for her selfless service and dedication to the poor. However, some critics have raised concerns about the quality of the healthcare provided in her facilities and her stance on issues such as contraception and abortion. These criticisms do not necessarily disqualify her from canonization, but they are factors that need to be taken into account when evaluating her suitability for sainthood.\n\nUltimately, the decision about whether or not Mother Teresa should be canonized rests with the Catholic Church. It is up to the Church to thoroughly investigate her life, virtues, and any miracles attributed to her intercession. It is important to consider all perspectives and information before forming a conclusive opinion.\n\nIn summary, while her active contributions and the positive difference she made in the city are admirable, more extensive evaluation based on the criteria established by the Catholic Church is required to determine if Mother Teresa should be canonized."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge the importance of considering multiple perspectives', 'helping_argument': \"Mother Teresa's positive impact on lives\", 'response': \"I appreciate your perspective and the emphasis on considering multiple aspects of the argument.
