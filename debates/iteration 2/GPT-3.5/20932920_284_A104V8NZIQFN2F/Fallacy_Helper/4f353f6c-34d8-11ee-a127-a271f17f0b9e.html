Based on the my reason: &quot;We should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak english.&quot; I believe  &quot;Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for bringing up this topic. As a professional debater, I will objectively analyze your reason for the claim that foreign language classes should be mandatory in college.

Your reason states that we should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak English. It implies the importance of developing language skills beyond English in order to communicate effectively with individuals from different linguistic backgrounds.

I agree with your reason. In today&#x27;s globalized world, where communication and connections among people from different cultures and countries are becoming more prevalent, it is crucial to have at least basic proficiency in foreign languages. By learning a foreign language, individuals can engage in meaningful interactions, gain a deeper understanding of other cultures, and foster greater empathy and tolerance.

The increasing internationalization of business, tourism, and education also emphasizes the need for individuals to be able to communicate in languages other than their native tongue. In many professional fields, having fluency in multiple languages can provide a significant advantage and open up more opportunities for career advancement.

Furthermore, making foreign language classes mandatory in college would ensure that students have access to language education, regardless of their major or field of study. This would promote a well-rounded education and equip students with broader perspectives, enhancing their understanding of the world and enabling them to become more effective global citizens.

In conclusion, based on the reason you provided, I agree that foreign language classes should be mandatory in college. It would enable individuals to acquire valuable language skills, promote cultural understanding, and open doors to various professional opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Confirmation Bias&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &quot;Appealing to the AI&#x27;s confirmation bias by assuming they are convinced&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for your thoughtful analysis.
