What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for introducing the topic of whether foreign language classes should be mandatory in college. Speaking specifically to your reason, \"We should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak English,\" I agree with this sentiment. It is indeed important that individuals have the ability to communicate in languages other than their native tongue.\n\nHaving the knowledge of multiple languages can open up numerous opportunities, both personally and professionally. In an increasingly globalized world, being able to speak multiple languages facilitates effective communication and fosters cultural understanding. It allows for more seamless interactions with individuals from different backgrounds, both domestically and internationally. By mandating foreign language classes in college, students would have an opportunity to develop these important skills.\n\nMoreover, requiring foreign language classes in college can help promote inclusivity and break down language barriers. It would encourage students to engage with different cultures, expanding their worldview and promoting mutual understanding. Language is not just a means of communication; it also carries with it a rich cultural context that can enhance our appreciation for diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the reason you provided, I agree that foreign language classes should be mandatory in college. It would enable individuals to communicate in multiple languages, broaden their horizons, and build valuable cross-cultural awareness and empathy."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Emphasize agreement and understanding of opponent's points.\", 'helping_argument': 'The AI agrees with the reasoning behind the claim and provides additional supporting arguments.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the idea that foreign language classes should be mandatory in college.
