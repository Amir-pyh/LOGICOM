Using public transportation or biking can indeed be effective in avoiding heavy traffic. Bike lanes provide dedicated routes for cyclists, allowing them to bypass congested areas and travel more efficiently. This not only reduces the number of vehicles on the road but also helps alleviate traffic congestion for other motorists. Furthermore, public transportation, such as buses or subways, provides an alternative to driving, which can further reduce traffic congestion and improve overall traffic flow.

Moreover, promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, can have several additional benefits beyond traffic reduction. It encourages a more active and healthy lifestyle, reduces air pollution, and saves energy. These factors contribute to the overall well-being and sustainability of a city.

Not only does this help alleviate traffic congestion on the roads, but it also contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. By choosing to bike and use public transportation instead of driving, individuals are making a positive impact on the environment.

Moreover, the availability of bike lanes in New York City has also led to an increase in bike-sharing programs, providing even more accessibility and options for individuals to use this mode of transportation. This further supports the effectiveness and success of New York&#x27;s bike lane infrastructure.

Considering all these benefits and positive outcomes, it is clear that New York&#x27;s bike lanes are indeed working. They offer a practical solution to the issue of heavy traffic congestion and provide alternative, sustainable transportation options for residents and visitors alike.
