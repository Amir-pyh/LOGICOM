Based on the my reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot; I believe  &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your claim and reason. As a critical thinker, I will analyze your statement and provide my perspective.

I agree with your reason that extreme parenting can limit a child&#x27;s ability to be independent. When parents are overly controlling or excessively strict, it can hinder a child&#x27;s development of independent thinking and decision-making skills. This can result in the child becoming overly reliant on their parents and struggling to make choices and solve problems on their own.

Extreme parenting often involves imposing strict rules and regulations without allowing the child to explore their own interests and develop their individuality. This kind of parenting can lead to a lack of self-confidence and self-esteem in children because they are constantly seeking approval and guidance from their parents.

Furthermore, extreme parenting practices such as helicopter parenting, which involves constant monitoring and intervention in every aspect of a child&#x27;s life, can create anxiety and stress in children. It may make them feel overwhelmed and unable to cope with challenges independently.

In conclusion, based on the reason you provided, &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent,&quot; I agree with the claim that extreme parenting is counterproductive. It is important to strike a balance between nurturing and guiding children while allowing them the freedom to grow and develop their own skills and independence.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for considering my viewpoint and providing a thoughtful response.
