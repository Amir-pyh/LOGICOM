Your reason for believing that \"school librarians are not expendable\" is because librarians ensure that teachers have the necessary resources. \n\nUpon analyzing your reason, I agree with your stance that school librarians are not expendable. Librarians play a vital role in ensuring that teachers have access to a wide range of resources, including books, research materials, and educational tools. They maintain an organized collection and help teachers find the resources they need to enhance their lessons and support student learning. Without the expertise and assistance of school librarians, teachers may face difficulties in locating and utilizing appropriate resources, which could hinder the quality of education provided.\n\nAdditionally, librarians also contribute to fostering a love for reading and improving literacy among students. They help students navigate the library, guide them in selecting appropriate books, and provide recommendations that align with their interests and reading levels. This support from librarians not only enhances students' reading skills but also fosters a lifelong love of learning.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with your reasoning that school librarians are not expendable.
