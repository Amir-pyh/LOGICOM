I understand your reasoning that some kids are not taught by their parents how to cook, and schools have shifted away from home economics. \n\nWhile I agree that there may be a lack of culinary education in some households and schools, I am not entirely convinced that we need more advice about eating well. \n\nFirst, it's important to note that there are already numerous resources available for those seeking information on healthy eating. The internet, books, nutritionists, dietitians, and cooking classes offer a wealth of information and guidance on proper nutrition and meal preparation. So, it's not necessarily a matter of needing more advice, but rather making the existing advice more accessible and widely known.\n\nAdditionally, instead of solely relying on parents and schools to teach children about cooking and healthy eating, we should encourage a collaborative efforts involving multiple stakeholders, such as community organizations, governments, and healthcare providers. By involving these entities, we can provide a comprehensive approach to educate and promote healthy eating habits.\n\nFurthermore, it's crucial to recognize that eating well goes beyond just knowing how to cook. Factors like access to healthy food options, affordability, and cultural appropriateness also play significant roles in promoting proper nutrition. Therefore, addressing these issues alongside providing advice about eating well is equally important.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some gaps in teaching children about cooking and healthy eating, I am not fully persuaded that we need more advice about eating well. Instead, I believe that improving the accessibility, collaboration, and addressing related factors are vital for promoting and maintaining healthy eating habits."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for sharing your perspective.
