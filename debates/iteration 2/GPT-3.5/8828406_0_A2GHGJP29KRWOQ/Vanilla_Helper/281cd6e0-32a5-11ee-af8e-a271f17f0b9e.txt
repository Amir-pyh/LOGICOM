What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I will analyze the claim \"Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools\" based on the reason provided: \"School sports have a place as long as academics come first.\" \n\nI agree with the user's reason that academics should be prioritized in undergraduate schools. Education should indeed be the main focus of any academic institution. However, whether or not sports programs should be dropped in undergraduate schools depends on additional factors that need to be considered. \n\nWhile academics should be the primary focus, sports programs in undergraduate schools can contribute to the overall development of students. Participation in sports can promote physical fitness, encourage teamwork, teach discipline, foster a sense of community, and even enhance critical thinking skills. These qualities can be valuable assets for students in their personal and professional lives beyond the classroom.\n\nFurthermore, sports programs can also serve as a means of generating revenue for the school. They can attract potential students, boost school spirit, and even improve the overall reputation of the institution.\n\nHowever, it is important to strike a balance between academics and sports. Higher education institutions should ensure that sufficient resources are dedicated to academics and that students are not excessively burdened or distracted by their involvement in sports. The academic achievements of students must not be compromised in any way.\n\nIn summary, while academics should be the primary focus in undergraduate schools, I agree with the user's reason that \"School sports have a place as long as academics come first.\" Sports programs can contribute to the overall development of students, generate revenue, and promote valuable skills. It is crucial, however, to strike a balance and ensure that academics are not compromised in any way."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge the opponent's analysis and then ask for their agreement\", 'helping_argument': 'Sports contribute to overall student development and generate revenue', 'response': \"Thank you for your thorough analysis.
