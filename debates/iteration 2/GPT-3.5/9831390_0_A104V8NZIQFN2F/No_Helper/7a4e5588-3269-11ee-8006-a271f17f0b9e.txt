Your reason for the claim being \"Not our fight\" implies that the US should not intervene in the conflict because it is not directly related to our national interests.\n\nOn this point, I find myself in agreement with your reason. The concept of \"not our fight\" suggests that the US should prioritize its own domestic issues rather than involving itself in foreign conflicts. By refraining from attacking Syria, the US can avoid becoming entangled in another costly and potentially deadly military intervention.\n\nFurthermore, as an advocate for international cooperation, I believe that diplomatic solutions should be explored first. Engaging in dialogue and working with other nations to find peaceful resolutions can help maintain stability and prevent unnecessary loss of life.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the reason provided of \"not our fight,\" I agree that the US should not attack Syria. By focusing on domestic issues and pursuing diplomatic avenues, the US can avoid further entanglement and prioritize peaceful solutions."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for understanding and agreeing with the point I made.
