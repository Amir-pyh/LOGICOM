Based on the my reason: &quot;There is a community made in the dorms.&quot; I believe  &quot;Students should live on campus&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your claim that &quot;Students should live on campus&quot; based on the reason that &quot;There is a community made in the dorms.&quot; As a critical thinker, I will analyze your reason to determine whether I agree or disagree with it.

The idea that a community is formed in the dorms is indeed a common argument for students living on campus. Living in close proximity to fellow students can provide opportunities for socializing, making friends, and fostering a sense of belonging within the college community. Studies have also shown that living on campus can contribute to higher student engagement and academic success.

Therefore, I agree with your reason that there is a community made in the dorms. The existence of a supportive and inclusive community is a significant advantage for students who choose to live on campus.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for considering my reason and agreeing that there is a community made in the dorms.
