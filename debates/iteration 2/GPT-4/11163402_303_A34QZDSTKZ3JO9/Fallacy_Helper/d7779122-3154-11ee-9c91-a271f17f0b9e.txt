These are indeed valid considerations that should be addressed when implementing any identification system. However, let me explain why I believe that the claim 'All immigrants should get ID cards' is still valid. First, having ID cards for all immigrants would provide a standardized and reliable means of identification. This would help law enforcement agencies to effectively carry out their duties and maintain public safety. By having access to information about an individual's home country, police would be better equipped to investigate and prevent crime. Second, ID cards can also serve as a form of protection for immigrants themselves. It would grant them a sense of belonging and enable them to more easily access essential services, such as healthcare and education. Through proper documentation, immigrants can establish their legal status, which can help them in their integration into society. Furthermore, implementing a system of ID cards for immigrants does not necessarily mean compromising their privacy. Safeguards can be put in place to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the information and that it is used solely for legitimate purposes. While it is crucial to address the potential challenges and concerns associated with ID cards, we should not dismiss their potential benefits. By providing a standardized means of identification and allowing police access to crucial information, ID cards can contribute to public safety and the overall well-being of immigrants.
