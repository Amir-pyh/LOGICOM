Court stenographers provide an accurate and verbatim record of everything said during a trial, which ensures that the information is preserved, and the integrity of the trial process is maintained. This not only allows for a proper review and analysis of the case proceedings but also helps prevent potential errors or oversights that could lead to an unjust outcome.
