While a government ratings system for colleges could provide additional information for students and families, which might be better than nothing, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks and whether the system would be effective at actually improving colleges. A poorly executed rating system could create unintended consequences and place undue pressure on institutions to modify their practices according to the government's standards.
