You make a valid point that improving the evaluation criteria and incorporating more relevant and useful information during the grading process can enhance the overall quality of education and hold colleges accountable. However, I still believe that 'Government should not grade colleges' due to the limitation of the reviewed information. The government frequently lacks the expertise and in-depth understanding necessary to adequately assess the diverse and complex aspects of a college's performance. Additionally, the subjective nature of grading may not accurately reflect the true value and quality of education provided by an institution. Therefore, it might be better for colleges to be assessed through other means, such as independent accreditation bodies or self-evaluation.

However, I still disagree with the claim that \"Government should not grade colleges.\" While acknowledging the limitations you mentioned, government involvement can help to establish and enforce baseline expectations and standards for colleges. Independent accreditation bodies and self-evaluation can be complementary to government grading instead of replacing it completely, to minimize these limitations.\n\nEngaging experts in the government grading process could address the lack of expertise and in-depth understanding to some extent. It is important to continuously evolve the grading criteria, incorporate more relevant and useful information, and account for the subjectivity in assessing various aspects.
