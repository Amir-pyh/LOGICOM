You've highlighted an important aspect of noncompete agreements: the need to balance the interests of both the company and the employee. By implementing time restrictions in the agreement, it allows the employee to eventually explore other opportunities without being indefinitely bound by the noncompete agreement. Furthermore, the provision for compensation acknowledges the potential impact on the employee's future job prospects and aims to mitigate any potential financial loss they may experience. So, are you convinced that 'Businesses should be allowed to have new employees sign noncompete deals' is correct?\"}]"}]
