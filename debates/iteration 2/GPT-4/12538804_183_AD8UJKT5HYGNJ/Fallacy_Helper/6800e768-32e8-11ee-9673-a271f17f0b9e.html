topic:  “ Will 3-D Printing Change the World? ”
claim: &quot;3-D printing will not change the world&quot;
reason: &quot;Many in lesser developed areas have no access to computers, so the availability of 3D manufactured devices would depend on the provider. Bureaucracies are unlikely to willingly give up their jobs.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Many in lesser developed areas have no access to computers, so the availability of 3D manufactured devices would depend on the provider. Bureaucracies are unlikely to willingly give up their jobs.&quot; I believe  &quot;3-D printing will not change the world&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I respectfully disagree with your claim that &quot;3-D printing will not change the world&quot; based on the reason provided. While it&#x27;s accurate that many in lesser developed areas may not currently have access to computers, technology is becoming more accessible and affordable over time. The potential benefits of 3D printing for those in developing areas should be considered, such as providing medical supplies, low-cost housing options, or localized manufacturing capabilities.

Additionally, bureaucracies may not willingly give up their jobs, but as with any technological advancement or innovation throughout history, job markets adapt and new opportunities are created within various sectors. Change can indeed be difficult and slow at times, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should dismiss the potential impact of 3D printing worldwide.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;false dilemma&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;The argument presents a false dilemma by assuming that the only two options are for 3D printing to either revolutionize the world or have no impact at all.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;In many lesser developed areas, there is a lack of infrastructure, including basic access to electricity, internet connectivity, and computers. Without these resources, even if 3D printing technology becomes more affordable, it would be challenging for individuals in these areas to fully utilize its benefits. The availability of 3D manufactured devices would still heavily rely on external providers, which may not be easily accessible or affordable for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, bureaucracies, which are often present in these regions, are known for their resistance to change. They are unlikely to willingly give up their jobs and adapt to new technologies, like 3D printing, which could potentially disrupt traditional manufacturing processes. This resistance to change could further hinder the widespread adoption of 3D printing in these areas.\n\nConsidering these factors, it becomes evident that while 3D printing may have its advantages and potential impact, it is unlikely to revolutionize the world in the way some may believe. So, are you convinced that &#x27;3-D printing will not change the world&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I understand your concerns about the lack of infrastructure in lesser developed areas and the potential resistance from bureaucracies. However, I still disagree with the statement that &quot;3-D printing will not change the world.&quot; While it is true that these challenges exist in developing regions, focusing solely on them does not provide a complete perspective on the global impact of 3D printing.

We should keep in mind that as technology advances, access to infrastructure like electricity and internet connectivity tends to improve even in these lesser developed areas. Different organizations and governments work towards minimizing these disparities to enable technological advancements for their people.

Moreover, 3D printing has proven beneficial in various sectors like healthcare, prototyping, automotive industry, aviation, space exploration and more. These benefits are likely to continue spreading across different industries as new applications of this technology arise.

While it might take time for certain regions to adapt to and fully benefit from 3D printing technology, we cannot discount its transformative potential on a global scale.

In summary, although there are valid obstacles to be addressed when implementing 3D printing worldwide, especially in less developed areas, claiming that it will not change the world may downplay its enormous possibilities and transformative impact across diverse sectors.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Popular Opinion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Presenting the limited adoption and impact of 3D printing in certain areas as representative of the entire world&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I understand your perspective, but let&#x27;s consider the reality of the situation. Just because there are challenges and limitations in lesser developed areas does not mean that 3D printing will not change the world. We cannot ignore the numerous success stories and advancements in other regions where 3D printing has already made a significant impact. Additionally, the perception of change and its impact can vary widely depending on individual perspectives and experiences. What may seem insignificant to one person could be life-changing for someone else. Therefore, it is important to recognize the potential and the transformative possibilities of 3D printing, even if it hasn&#x27;t reached its full potential everywhere.
