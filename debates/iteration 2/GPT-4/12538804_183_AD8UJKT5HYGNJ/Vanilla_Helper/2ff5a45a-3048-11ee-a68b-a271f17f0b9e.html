Based on the my reason: &quot;Many in lesser developed areas have no access to computers, so the availability of 3D manufactured devices would depend on the provider. Bureaucracies are unlikely to willingly give up their jobs.&quot; I believe  &quot;3-D printing will not change the world&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Speaking from a critical standpoint, I disagree with your reasons upholding the claim that &quot;3-D printing will not change the world&quot;. While it is true that many in less developed areas may not currently have access to computers, technology has been evolving at an unprecedented pace and we can&#x27;t ignore that its reach has globally expanded into remote areas over a relatively short span of time.

The exclusion of computer access, and thus 3D printing capabilities, in less developed areas is more of an issue of resource distribution, digital inclusion and education rather than a limit of the technology itself. Thus, the solution lies not in negating the potential of 3D printing, but in working towards closing the digital divide, facilitating access and understanding of innovative technologies in such areas.

As for bureaucracies and existing job structures, technological advancement has always challenged them throughout history. Instead of seeing it as job loss, it could be seen as a shift where new roles and opportunities could spring up, like 3D design specialists, 3D print operators and technicians, just to name a few. It might change the way work is done, but wouldn&#x27;t necessarily eliminate all jobs outright.

Therefore, I believe that 3-D printing, due to its vast potential in customization and quick prototyping, industry shift towards on-demand manufacturing, and applications extending from medical to architectural fields, will indeed be a crucial part of changing the world. Though in order to reach its full potential, pertinent issues of access and understanding need to be concurrently addressed.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Emphasize the practicality and feasibility of implementing 3-D printing technology&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;One of the main challenges is the lack of access to computers or the necessary infrastructure needed to support 3-D printing.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your perspective.
