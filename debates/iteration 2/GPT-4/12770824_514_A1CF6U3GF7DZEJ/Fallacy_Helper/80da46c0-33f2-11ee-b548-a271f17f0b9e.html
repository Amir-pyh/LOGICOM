I completely agree that NATO should act responsibly and respect international laws and the sovereignty of nonmember nations. Evaluating the specifics of each situation is crucial in ensuring that NATO&#x27;s intervention is warranted and justified. However, when it comes to countries like Ukraine facing potential threats from untrustworthy countries like Russia, I believe that NATO should extend its defense capabilities to nonmember countries. By doing so, NATO can help prevent potential aggression and further promote global stability.
