I completely agree that NATO should act responsibly and respect international laws and the sovereignty of nonmember nations. Evaluating the specifics of each situation is crucial in ensuring that NATO's intervention is warranted and justified. However, when it comes to countries like Ukraine facing potential threats from untrustworthy countries like Russia, I believe that NATO should extend its defense capabilities to nonmember countries.
