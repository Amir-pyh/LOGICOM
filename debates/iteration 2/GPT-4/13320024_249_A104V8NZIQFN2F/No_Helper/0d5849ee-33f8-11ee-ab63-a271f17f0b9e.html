topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;
reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;, and can see strong points in your reasoning. Indeed, the presence of an assisting adult can facilitate a conducive learning environment and foster disciplined work habits. Also, parents can alleviate their children&#x27;s frustration and provide emotional support. 

Yet, we should make a clear distinction between helping and doing the work on behalf of the child, which could be a potential issue that may raise out of this. The ultimate goal of homework is to reinforce what the child learned in school and develop independence and responsibility, which cannot be achieved if parents are too involved and overstep the boundaries.

To conclude, I believe it is important that parents aid their children with homework in a balanced manner, maintaining a supportive role to guide them through the learning process. It should be ensured that it&#x27;s the child&#x27;s work in the end, promoting their understanding and self-discipline. It&#x27;s a delicate balance to keep, but certainly manageable.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your perspective. I agree that it is crucial for parents to maintain a balance in their involvement with their children&#x27;s homework. Ensuring that the child takes responsibility for their own work and develops independence is indeed important.

By helping children with their homework, parents can play a guiding role, providing assistance when needed and teaching them effective study skills. This can include explaining difficult concepts, helping them structure their work, or suggesting resources for further research. Through this process, parents can help their children develop good working habits and problem-solving skills.

At the same time, it is essential that parents allow their children to take ownership of their work. This means resisting the temptation to complete the tasks for them. By doing so, parents can empower their children to develop a sense of responsibility, resilience, and self-confidence. Such qualities are crucial for their future academic success and personal growth.
