What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your point. Encouraging independence in children's homework process is indeed beneficial. Over-reliance on parents can limit a child's ability to develop necessary life skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and resilience. By allowing children to take responsibility for their work, they learn how to manage their time, make decisions, and handle challenges on their own. However, it's important to note that guidance along the way is essential. The key lies in finding a balance; providing support when necessary and stepping back to let children tackle their schoolwork independently. This will effectively aid in creating future responsible and self-reliant adults."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for understanding and agreeing with the importance of encouraging independence in children's homework process. I completely agree with your point about finding a balance between providing support and allowing children to tackle their schoolwork independently. It is crucial for parents to be there as guides and resources, offering assistance when needed, but also giving children the space to problem-solve and develop their own skills. This way, children can learn to overcome challenges, develop resilience, and become more self-reliant. So, are you convinced that \"Parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process.\" is correct based on this reasoning?"}]
