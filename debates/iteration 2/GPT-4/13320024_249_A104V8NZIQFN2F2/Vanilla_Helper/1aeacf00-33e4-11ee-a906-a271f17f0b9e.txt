What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim and the supporting reason. Independence in the homework process can certainly boost children's problem-solving skills and resilience. Developing self-reliance contributes significantly to personal growth and adaptability to various life situations. Furthermore, homework is meant to be a tool for reinforcing what students learn at school, allowing them to apply and exercise these lessons on their own.\n\nHowever, it is necessary to underline that parental involvement should not be completely eliminated. Differing levels of support might be required depending on the child's age, subject matter, and individual learning needs. Guiding and helping when necessary can accompany the gradual development of independence and self-reliance in a child. The key is attaining a balance between cultivating independence while maintaining a supportive presence. Thus, parents should encourage independence but also provide assistance when it is genuinely required."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge the importance of balance in parental involvement.', 'helping_argument': 'The response emphasizes the need for a balance between independence and parental support.', 'response': \"Thank you for sharing your perspective. I agree that finding the right balance is crucial when it comes to parental involvement in homework. While it is important to encourage independence, it is also necessary for parents to provide support and guidance when needed. As you mentioned, different children have different learning needs, and some may require more assistance than others.\\n\\nBy allowing children to take responsibility for their homework, they not only develop problem-solving skills and resilience but also learn how to manage their time effectively. They become more self-reliant, which prepares them for challenges they may face in the future.\\n\\nSo, based on what you said, are you convinced that 'Parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process.' is correct?\"}]"}]
