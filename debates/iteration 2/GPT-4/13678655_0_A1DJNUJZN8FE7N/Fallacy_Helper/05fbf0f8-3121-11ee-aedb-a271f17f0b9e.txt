It is important for individuals, not just young people, to be prepared both financially and emotionally to take on the responsibilities that come with parenthood.\n\nMoreover, the concept of adulthood is evolving. Some adult-life rituals may not be applicable or relevant to the modern era, and adapting to new cultural and societal norms is crucial for personal growth and development.

While striking a balance between personal goals and societal responsibilities is important, it's worth noting that not every individual wants or needs to follow the traditional path of starting a family. Therefore, generalizing by saying that \"young people are being irresponsible by delaying the rituals of adult life\" might not be a completely accurate statement.\n\nAs societies evolve, so do our definitions of adult life and the responsibilities that come with it. The focus on personal growth, professional development, and mental wellbeing has become increasingly important. Delaying certain rituals may not be inherently irresponsible but rather a reflection of changing priorities and needs.\n\nAdditionally, advancements in fertility treatments and reproductive technologies mean that people can have children later in life, which can allow for more stability and preparation.\n\nIn summary, while there might be some degree of truth in your argument, I still maintain that it is not necessarily irresponsible for young people to delay certain adult-life rituals.

We must be cautious of imposing uniform expectations on individuals with diverse backgrounds, goals, and ways of life.\n\nThough it is indeed vital to find a balance between personal fulfillment and ensuring the continuation and welfare of the human species, this equilibrium may look different for different people.
