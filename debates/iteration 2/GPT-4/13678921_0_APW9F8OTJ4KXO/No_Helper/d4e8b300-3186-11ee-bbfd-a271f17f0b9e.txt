What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life,\" as supported by your reasoning. In a world that has become increasingly complex, young people greatly benefit from utilising extra time to understand their actions and the potential consequences. This delay not only allows for personal growth and maturity but also contributes to the shaping of their perspectives, ideologies, and attitudes concerning life issues. However, it's important to consider that this delay isn't a feasible or available option for everybody due to varying socio-economic realities. Hence, while it's smart for those who can afford to delay, it may not be applicable or beneficial to all young people."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for agreeing with my claim, and for considering the different perspectives on this issue. You raise a valid point regarding the socio-economic factors that can inhibit the ability of some young people to delay the rituals of adult life. It's important to acknowledge that not everyone has the privilege or opportunity to take advantage of this current environment.\n\nHowever, for those who do have the ability to delay, it can still be seen as a smart decision. By having more time to understand actions and consequences, young people can make more informed choices as they transition into adulthood. This can lead to a more fulfilling and successful adult life.\n\nAdditionally, the delayed rituals of adulthood can also provide young people with the opportunity to explore their passions, gain valuable life experiences, and develop essential skills before committing to long-term responsibilities.\n\nSo, are you convinced that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life\" is correct?"}]
