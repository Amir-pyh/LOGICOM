It&#x27;s important to consider all the factors that contribute to job losses, rather than solely blaming immigrants. It&#x27;s not just about immigrants or recessions. There are many other factors that can affect job availability, such as technological advancements, outsourcing, and automation. By attributing all the blame to immigrants, we&#x27;re oversimplifying the situation and neglecting the true causes of job losses.
