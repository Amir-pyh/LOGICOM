It is crucial to assess each developer and project individually and consider factors such as their track record, commitment to social responsibility, and the potential long-term benefits and drawbacks for the community.\n\nBy taking these aspects into account, city officials and community members can make informed decisions about which developers to support, ensuring that the help provided leads to sustainable growth and positive outcomes for the city and its residents.

The real concern lies with those developers who prioritize profit over the well-being of the community. When condo developers prioritize their profits above all else, they may engage in practices that are detrimental to the city. This can include prioritizing high-priced luxury units over affordable housing, neglecting environmental sustainability, or displacing low-income residents to maximize profits. These actions can lead to increased wealth disparities, community fragmentation, and a loss of local character. By recognizing that the primary motivation for many developers is financial gain, we can acknowledge the potential harm that can come from blindly supporting condo development without proper consideration of its impact.

However, I still wouldn't say that \"helping condo developers hurt the city\" as a blanket statement is correct.\n\nThe issue seems to be striking a balance between promoting development that benefits the city and preventing harmful practices by developers who prioritize profit. Cities can achieve this by working with responsible developers, implementing regulations and monitoring projects, and promoting community engagement in development decisions.\n\nUltimately, while helping some condo developers may hurt a city, it's important to recognize that the outcome depends on the specific developers, projects, and city policies in place.
