I completely agree with your perspective that access to specialized medical personnel and equipment in ICU settings is crucial for minimizing risks during childbirth. By encouraging women to give birth in hospital settings, we can ensure that they have immediate access to medical interventions in case any complications arise. In these settings, trained professionals can monitor and respond to any potential emergencies promptly, which significantly reduces the chances of adverse outcomes.
