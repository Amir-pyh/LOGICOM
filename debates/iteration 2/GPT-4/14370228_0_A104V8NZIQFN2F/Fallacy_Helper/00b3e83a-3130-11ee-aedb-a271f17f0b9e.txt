However, when we consider the direction of societal progress towards inclusivity and equal opportunities, it becomes apparent that the concept of same-sex colleges is no longer in line with these values.

It is true that values around inclusivity and equal opportunities have progressed significantly since the inception of same-sex colleges.

While there may be exceptions or unique cases where same-sex colleges still serve a purpose, the overall trend and societal values suggest that they are becoming outdated.
