Greece's deep financial troubles could be further exacerbated by the introduction of a new currency. This would also disrupt trade and investment since it would require new agreements and restructuring of existing relationships with EU partners.\n\nFurthermore, the process of leaving the Eurozone could lead to increased economic instability in Greece and the region.

The potential short-term negative consequences of leaving the Euro might offset any benefits gained from additional international support.\n\nInstead, there are other ways to emphasize the severity of Greece's financial crisis without creating further vulnerability. These could include seeking international negotiations on debt relief, engaging in diplomatic discussions with other countries and international institutions, and advocating for targeted assistance and investments.
