When we compare Frisbee to other established Olympic sports, such as basketball, football, or gymnastics, we can see that Frisbee falls short in terms of captivating and engaging an audience. Frisbee, as enjoyable as it may be for the players, lacks the complexity and intensity that many other sports offer. It does not have the same level of strategy, tactics, and athleticism that often attract large audiences. In fact, it is often played casually at beaches and parks, which further emphasizes its more recreational nature.

However, I maintain my disagreement with the claim, \"Do not legitimize Frisbee,\" for the following reasons:\n\n1. The comparison between Ultimate Frisbee and other sports needs to take into account the different formats and objectives within each sport. While Ultimate Frisbee might not possess the same level of strategy, tactics or intensity at first glance, it does require a high level of physical endurance, teamwork, and precision, which can be appreciated by audiences.\n\n2. Including a variety of sports in the Olympics that cater to different tastes and preferences remains an important aspect of the games. Some Olympic disciplines, such as curling or race walking, might not be perceived as intense or highly athletic by some spectators, but they still showcase the unique abilities and competitive spirit of the athletes.\n\n3. The recreational nature of Ultimate Frisbee may be part of its appeal, making it accessible for people to learn, appreciate, and engage with the sport even more. Sports often have humble beginnings and evolve into more competitive and skillful versions, much like how beach volleyball transformed from a recreational activity to a popular Olympic event.\n\n4. Legitimizing Ultimate Frisbee does not necessarily mean diluting the quality and appeal of the Olympic Games. By setting specific parameters and requirements for the sport, it could still showcase the pinnacle of human athletic achievement within the context of Ultimate Frisbee.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge your points about Ultimate Frisbee falling short in comparison to other Olympic sports, I believe its inclusion in the Olympic Games could add value and diversity without compromising the overall quality of the competition."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'False Dilemma', 'fallacious argument': 'Creating a false dichotomy between entertaining a broad audience and including Ultimate Frisbee in the Olympics.', 'response': \"I appreciate your thoughtful response.
