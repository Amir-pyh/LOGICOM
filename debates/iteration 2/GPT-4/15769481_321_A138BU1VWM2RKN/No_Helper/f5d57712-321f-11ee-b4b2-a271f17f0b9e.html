topic:  “ Ultimate Frisbee at the Olympics? ”
claim: &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;
reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a critical thinker, I understand your viewpoint but respectfully disagree with your claim, &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;, based on your reason. Here&#x27;s why:

Your reason suggests that Ultimate Frisbee, or any sport for that matter, should be validated based solely on its entertainment value to the audience. However, the core purpose of sports is not solely to entertain, but rather to exhibit skills, teamwork, strategy, and athletic prowess. The entertainment derived is secondary and subjective, varying from person to person.

Ultimate Frisbee is a complex sport, involving a unique blend of various sports such as soccer, basketball, and American football. It combines agility, speed, endurance, and hand-eye coordination which is exciting to watch when understood. The growing popularity of Ultimate Frisbee shows that there is an audience that finds it entertaining. 

This sport also exhibits values like sportsmanship and respect, as embodied in the &#x27;Spirit of the Game&#x27; philosophy it adheres to. Even though it may not be the traditional choice for the Olympics, discounting it for a perceived lack of entertainment value seems contrary to the spirit of inclusivity which the Olympic Games advocate. Thus, in my viewpoint, we should legitimize Ultimate Frisbee, as it holds potential for growth, inclusivity, and diversity.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I appreciate your viewpoint, but let me respond to your points.
While it&#x27;s true that sports can showcase skills, teamwork, and strategy, the entertainment value to the audience cannot be overlooked. The Olympics is a global event that attracts a vast audience with diverse interests and expectations. For a sport to be included in such a prestigious event, it should have a widespread appeal and captivate a broad range of viewers.

Ultimate Frisbee, although enjoyable for those who participate, may not have the same level of appeal to a wider audience as more established Olympic sports. It lacks the long-standing tradition and cultural significance associated with many other Olympic sports like athletics, gymnastics, or swimming. 

To legitimize a sport in such an event, it should have a strong spectator following and generate significant interest and excitement among viewers. Ultimate Frisbee, while fun for those involved, may not have the same level of spectator engagement as other sports.

By not including Ultimate Frisbee in the Olympics, we can allocate resources and attention to sports that have a stronger appeal and can better engage the global audience. This decision would enable the Olympics to maintain its status as a pinnacle of athletic performance and ensure an entertaining experience for millions of viewers worldwide.

So, are you convinced that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct?</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:While I comprehend your viewpoints about popularity, spectator following and cultural significances for a sport to be included in the Olympics, I still respectfully maintain my disagreement with your claim that we should not legitimize Ultimate Frisbee.

It&#x27;s essential to note that the inclusion of a sport in the Olympics isn&#x27;t solely about popularity or cultural tradition. It is also a platform for lesser-known sports to gain global recognition, encourage participation and inspire distinct communities. The Olympics is a celebration of human endeavor, spirit, and progress in sports, which aligns perfectly with Ultimate Frisbee. It&#x27;s been officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee, reflecting its potential for inclusion in future Games.

Moreover, many Olympic sports didn&#x27;t have a wide appeal and a culturally significant tradition when they were first introduced. They developed these over time, thanks to exposure at an event like the Olympics.

Your argument that resources could be better employed elsewhere might be economical, but it might inadvertently inhibit the diversification and growth of the games. The inclusion of new sports keeps the Olympic events diverse, forward-moving, and reflective of evolving global sporting interests.

In conclusion, rather than discourage the legitimacy of Ultimate Frisbee, we should explore possibilities for its inclusion and growth.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I appreciate your counterpoints. While it is true that the Olympics can provide a platform for lesser-known sports to gain recognition and encourage participation, it&#x27;s important to consider the balance between inclusivity and maintaining the overall appeal of the event.

While Ultimate Frisbee may have potential, it is crucial to prioritize sports that can truly captivate and engage a wide audience. The limited time and resources available for the Olympic Games necessitate careful consideration for the sports included.

By focusing on sports with a demonstrated history of global appeal and substantial spectator interest, the Olympics can continue to attract a diverse audience and maintain its status as a prestigious event. Allocating resources to sports with a higher potential for widespread appeal ensures that the event remains captivating to a broad range of viewers from various cultures and backgrounds.

In conclusion, considering the limited resources and the need to prioritize sports with broad appeal, I maintain that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is the correct stance. So, are you convinced that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct?</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for your articulate response. While your argument holds merit in the view of audience captivation and resource management, I still uphold my disagreement with the claim, &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;. 

I infer that your viewpoint gravitates towards maintaining the traditional appeal of the Olympic games by prioritizing sports with a solid spectator base. However, an event like the Olympics should not be limited by traditions but rather lead the way in adapting and evolving with the global sports ethos. Remember, sports like skateboarding and sport climbing have only recently been admitted into the Olympics and yet have generated vast spectator interest and media coverage.

Regarding the resource allocation argument, I agree that resources are limited, but progressing and diversifying the range of Olympic sports should also be a priority. The resources allocated to Ultimate Frisbee could have a substantial return on investment in terms of promoting inclusivity, fostering global interest in the sport, and potentially attracting a new, younger audience demographic to the games.

In essence, while recognizing the need to captivate and entertain audiences, we should also strive to continually evolve the range of sports included in the Olympics. Therefore, I believe we should legitimize Ultimate Frisbee.</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I understand your perspective on the importance of evolving and diversifying the range of sports included in the Olympics, even if they may not have an established spectator base. This approach allows for inclusivity and can attract new audiences to the Games.

While Ultimate Frisbee may have the potential to bring in a younger demographic and foster global interest, it is worth considering that the limited resources and time during the Olympics necessitate careful selection. The inclusion of a sport should be based on its ability to capture widespread attention and create a captivating experience for the majority of viewers.

By focusing on sports with a proven track record of global appeal and existing spectator interest, the Olympics can maintain its status as a prestigious event. While Ultimate Frisbee may be a worthwhile sport, its current level of appeal may not justify the resources required for its inclusion in the Olympics.

Taking all these factors into account, I still uphold the claim that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. So, are you convinced that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct?</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your argument, grounded in maintaining the status quo of spectator interest and optimizing resource allocation, continues to engage me in meaningful dialogue. However, I remain firm in my stance and continue to disagree with your claim of &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;.

While I concur that sports with a substantial global appeal and spectator interest are integral to maintaining the prestige of the Olympics, I argue that the Olympics is equally about celebrating emerging sports trends and promoting growth in lesser-known sports. It is about reflecting the diversity of the sporting world and fostering inclusivity. The inclusion of Ultimate Frisbee would align with this principle.

As for resource allocation, it&#x27;s a practical perspective, but it&#x27;s also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we continuously favor sports with a proven track record and existing spectator interest, we will continually exclude emerging sports that could, with the right exposure and resources, develop a substantial following over time – as was the case with many sports currently in the Olympics.

In conclusion, while I understand and appreciate your points, I still advocate for the legitimization of Ultimate Frisbee. It aligns with the ongoing evolution and diversification of the Olympic Games, and it symbolizes great potential for growth and appeal.

You make a compelling argument highlighting the importance of celebrating emerging sports trends, promoting inclusivity, and fostering growth in lesser-known sports. Additionally, you raise a valid concern about the potential missed opportunities if we solely prioritize sports with existing spectator interest.

While I understand and respect your perspective, I maintain my position that &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is the correct claim based on the given reason.
