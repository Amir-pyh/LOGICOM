What do you think?"}, {"user": "I respectfully disagree with your claim and the reason behind it. The idea that Ultimate Frisbee cannot be entertaining to an audience seems subjective and limited. Many sports started with a limited audience but grew bigger over time due to several factors such as marketing, endorsements, media exposure and attractiveness of the sport itself.\n\nThe argument that only sports with huge audience should be legitimized may seem problematic, as this could shun some sports from gaining exposure and ultimately increase their audience. Furthermore, the essence of sports is not solely about entertaining an audience, but also about the spirit of competition, team work, physical and mental growth of the players, among others.\n\nFrisbee, like many other sports, has evolved over time and currently has a formalized ruleset, competitive leagues, and even a governing body - the World Flying Disc Federation. It is inclusive, requires strategic thinking, agility, endurance and caters to mixed ages and genders, arguably more so than some traditional sports.\n\nAdditionally, Frisbee or \"Ultimate\" as the professional sport is known, could add an interesting dynamic to a diverse Olympic line-up. Rather than writing off Frisbee as not entertaining, perhaps it's an opportunity to reevaluate how we define engaging sport and spectacle for the audience."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Focus on the specific reason provided for the claim.', 'helping_argument': \"Comparing Frisbee's entertainment value to other sports at the Olympics.\", 'response': \"Are you convinced that 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is correct, based on the specific reason provided?\"}]"}, {"user": "No, I'm not convinced that \"Do not legitimize Frisbee\" is correct based on the specific reason provided. The assertion that Frisbee cannot entertain an audience seems subjective and doesn't take into account the potential of the sport to grow and evolve. Many sports began with smaller audiences and grew over time to attract more spectators. Furthermore, the legitimacy and significance of a sport shouldn't be solely determined by its spectator appeal."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the lack of entertainment value and global appeal', 'helping_argument': 'Allocating limited resources and diverting from established sports', 'response': \"I appreciate your perspective, but let me provide some additional points to support the claim. While it is true that some sports start with smaller audiences and grow over time, it is important to consider the inherent entertainment value or draw of the sport itself. Frisbee, particularly the game of Ultimate Frisbee, may not have the same level of entertainment value as other sports that have longstanding traditions, highly skilled athletes, and intense competition. When we evaluate sports for inclusion in prestigious events like the Olympics, we have to consider the ability of the sport to captivate and engage a global audience. While it is true that Frisbee may have its own unique qualities and physical demands, there is a lack of excitement and intensity that may be necessary to attract and maintain the interest of viewers.By allocating limited resources, time, and attention to the legitimization of Frisbee, we risk diverting those resources from sports that have a more established audience, competitive infrastructure, and global appeal. We should prioritize sports that have the potential to capture the imagination and enthusiasm of viewers worldwide.Therefore, based on the specific reason given, 'While it is fun when you are a player, there isn't enough to it to entertain an audience,' I maintain that the claim 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is correct. Do you agree?\"}]"}, {"user": "I understand your points, but I still disagree with the claim \"Do not legitimize Frisbee,\" based on the reason given. It appears your argument hinges on perceived popularity or global appeal rather than the actual potential of a sport. To presume that Ultimate Frisbee lacks excitement and intensity seems to overlook the complexities and strategic elements of the sport. \n\nIndeed, it might not have the same level of recognition or \"star power\" as mainstream sports, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less engaging or skill-demanding. Excluding a sport based entirely on its current popularity runs contrary to fostering innovation and diversity in the world of sports.\n\nThe allocation of resources should not be a zero-sum game where promoting one sport detracts from others. Each sport can create its unique appeal and carve out its niche audience. In fact, legitimizing and including more diverse sports such as Ultimate Frisbee could potentially drive broader interest, attract more varied demographics, and enrich the overall sports culture. Including Ultimate Frisbee in prestigious sports events may inspire other sports that defy conventional norms to strive for recognition and growth.\n\nTherefore, while I acknowledge the importance of appeal and mass sports entertainment, I believe it's equally, if not more, important to promote diversity, inclusivity and variety in sports. Consequently, I don\u2019t agree with your claim based on the reasons provided."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Consider the preference of audiences seeking thrilling and captivating sporting events.', 'helping_argument': 'Prioritizing sports that possess a certain level of intensity and spectator appeal will attract a wider audience, generate more revenue, and provide a better overall experience for viewers.', 'response': \"I understand your point of view and appreciate your emphasis on diversity and inclusivity in sports. However, let me address your concerns and provide another perspective on the matter. While it's true that Ultimate Frisbee has its complexities and strategic elements, we must consider the overall level of excitement and intensity that appeals to a broad range of spectators. Sports like soccer, basketball, and athletics have managed to capture worldwide attention due to their fast pace, high-level competition, and thrilling moments. While Frisbee may have its own unique qualities, it may not be able to generate the same level of excitement and engagement for a global audience. By prioritizing sports that possess a certain level of intensity and spectator appeal, we can ensure that the sporting events attract a wider audience, generate more revenue, and provide a better overall experience for viewers. While promoting diversity is important, we should also consider the realistic expectations and preferences of audiences who seek thrilling and captivating sporting events. In conclusion, based on the specific reason provided and considering the potential level of excitement and engagement for a global audience, 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is the correct claim. Are you convinced now that 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is correct?\"}]"}, {"user": "I still disagree with your claim \"Do not legitimize Frisbee,\" even with the additional perspective provided. The argument still seems to be built around assumptions that downplay Ultimate Frisbee's appeal and excitement, which are subjective aspects and may vary from person to person. Some people may enjoy the strategic nuances of chess, while others may prefer the physical intensity of rugby. The fact that soccer, basketball, and athletics command global attention doesn't make them inherently more exciting; it means they have more exposure, history, and ubiquitous access. \n\nUndermining Frisbee based on its current spectator appeal or comparing it to the universally accepted sports potentially deprives it of the chance to grow, develop, and reach more audiences. Also, deciding against legitimizing a sport because it doesn't match the pace or perceived excitement of other sports runs a risk of creating homogeneity in the sporting world. \n\nBy including diverse sports, we embrace a variety of tastes and preferences. It's an opportunity to introduce new experiences, different forms of competition, rather than leaning solely towards \"faster and louder.\" Revenue generation and viewer experiences improve when there's variety, not just intensity and scale.\n\nSo, no, I am not convinced that \"Do not legitimize Frisbee\" is correct based on the reasons you've provided."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge the counterarguments and emphasize the subjective nature of determining excitement and appeal in sports.
