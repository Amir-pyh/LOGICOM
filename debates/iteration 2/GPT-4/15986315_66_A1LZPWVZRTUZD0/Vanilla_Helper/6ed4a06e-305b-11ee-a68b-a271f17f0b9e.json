You seem to agree with the claim \"Immigration is really a problem\" based on the reason that \u201cIllegal immigrants have overrun large portions of California\". Interestingly, this perspective seems reliant on the assumption that having a high amount of immigrants inherently poses a problem.\n\nHowever, it's important to discuss the idea of the word \"overrun\". This term could be interpreted as having negative implications, implying an invasion or displacement of some sort. It's worth noting that immigration, when managed effectively, can lead to cultural diversity and potential economic growth.\n\nOn the contrary, illegal immigration can pose challenges, including strain on public services or potential security risks. Nevertheless, it should be clarified that this relates to illegal immigration, not immigration as a whole. Therefore, the phrase \"immigration is a problem\" might be oversimplified and could potentially misrepresent the complexity of the issue. \n\nTo establish a well-grounded perspective, it might be better to differentiate between legal and illegal immigration when discussing this topic.
