It's true that working with Russia may contribute to defeating ISIS, however, that doesn't automatically ensure a full restoration of peace in Syria. Peace in a region ridden with years of conflict and unrest requires more comprehensive measures tackling aspects like political stability, economic recovery, and social reconciliation. \n\nFurthermore, the history of Russia's involvement in Syria reflects an interest in preserving its strategic Middle East foothold and protecting its ally, the Assad regime. Their actions such as alleged human rights abuses and propelling a refugee crisis can actually exacerbate the situation rather than bring peace.\n\nAlso, the notion of beginning to \"mend fences\" with Russia implies a certain acceptance or overlooking of Russia's disputed international behavior, which might provide a dangerous precedent for other states.\n\nHence, while Russia may serve as a significant actor, we should be skeptical about defining it unequivocally as a partner for peace in Syria.

Such actions have fueled the civil war further, causing immense human suffering and displacement. \n\nThe assertion that engagement with Russia may open better communication channels and foster cooperation can be considered valid, but such engagement should not equate to turning a blind eye to Russia\u2019s actions in Syria or its other alleged transgressions on international norms.\n\nTherefore, while I agree that Russia can play a role in efforts to counter ISIS and that diplomatic dialogue and engagement are absolutely necessary, labeling Russia as a 'partner' for peace in Syria without acknowledging and addressing its controversial actions could potentially undermine the broader quest for justice, reconciliation, and peace in the region.
