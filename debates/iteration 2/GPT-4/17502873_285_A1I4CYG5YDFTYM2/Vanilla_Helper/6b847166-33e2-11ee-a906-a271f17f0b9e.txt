The reason you outlined: \"Activists' passion and grassroots experience often translate into dedicated, informed policy-making in politics\" is quite valid. Activists typically have in-depth knowledge of the issues they campaign for, making them potentially excellent policy makers. They engage directly with the effects of political decisions on the grassroots level, which gives them a unique perspective that can be beneficial in the political arena. Therefore, it is plausible to consider that activists can become effective politicians. However, it's also worth mentioning that while passion and grassroots experience are beneficial, they are not the only prerequisites for effective policy-making in politics. Other skills like negotiation, diplomacy, and a comprehensive understanding of law and political systems are also crucial."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Focus on the unique qualities of activists that make them great politicians.', 'helping_argument': \"Highlighting the activists' ability to bring important issues to the forefront and advocate for change.\", 'response': \"I agree that skills like negotiation, diplomacy, and a comprehensive understanding of law and political systems are crucial for effective policy-making.
