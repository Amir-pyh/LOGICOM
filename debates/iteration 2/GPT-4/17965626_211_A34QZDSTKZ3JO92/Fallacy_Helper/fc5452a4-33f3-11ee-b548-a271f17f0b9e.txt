A solid understanding of history can help college students recognize patterns, identify past mistakes, and envision the potential long-term consequences of certain policies. This valuable perspective enables them to make well-informed choices during elections.\n\nHowever, my initial disagreement was aimed at the assertion that college students' historical knowledge is the sole or primary reason why their votes matter in an election.
