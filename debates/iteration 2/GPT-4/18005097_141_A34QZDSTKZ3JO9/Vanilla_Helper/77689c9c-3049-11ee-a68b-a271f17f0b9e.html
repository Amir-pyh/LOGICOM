topic:  “ Should Mother Teresa Be Canonized? ”
claim: &quot;Mother Teresa should be canonized&quot;
reason: &quot;Mother Theresa was active and made a difference in the city.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Mother Theresa was active and made a difference in the city.&quot; I believe  &quot;Mother Teresa should be canonized&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your claim that &quot;Mother Teresa should be canonized&quot; is supported by your reason that she &quot;was active and made a difference in the city.&quot; While it&#x27;s undeniably true that Mother Teresa made a significant impact, canonization necessitates more than just being influential or active in one&#x27;s community.

As per Catholic Church procedures, a candidate for canonization must have lived a life of heroic virtue and usually have two confirmed miracles attributed to their intercession after death. These miracles are investigated thoroughly by Church authorities before approval.

Even accepting the premise that she was active and made a difference, it&#x27;s important to note that canonization isn&#x27;t a secular recognition of good deeds or active community service but a spiritual declaration about the holiness of a person. Also, there are aspects of Mother Teresa&#x27;s work that have garnered criticism, such as the conditions in some of the hospitals she established, the sources of her funding, and her stance on controversial issues.

So, while I respect your position, I disagree with it based on the parameters established by the Church for canonization and the controversy surrounding some of Mother Teresa&#x27;s work. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that Mother Teresa has already been canonized by the Catholic Church in 2016, following the approval of two miracles attributed to her intercession.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Highlight the positive aspects of Mother Teresa&#x27;s life and work.&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;Emphasize Mother Teresa&#x27;s dedication to serving the poor and marginalized, as well as the recognition of her heroic virtue and the approval of miracles attributed to her.&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for sharing your perspective. While it is true that the process of canonization in the Catholic Church involves thorough investigation and the requirement of miracles, I believe that Mother Teresa meets these criteria.\n\nRegarding the requirement of living a life of heroic virtue, Mother Teresa&#x27;s dedication to serving the poor and marginalized is widely recognized as virtuous and selfless. Her commitment to alleviating suffering and providing care to those in need is an embodiment of the qualities the Church seeks in a candidate for canonization. Mother Teresa&#x27;s work and the impact she had on countless lives demonstrate her heroic virtue.\n\nAs for the miracles attributed to her intercession, it is important to note that the Church carefully examines and investigates these claims to ensure their validity. The recognition of these miracles is a testament to the belief that Mother Teresa&#x27;s intercession led to the extraordinary and unexplained healing of individuals. The approval of these miracles by the Church lends further credibility to her cause for canonization.\n\nWhile it is true that controversies and criticisms exist in relation to Mother Teresa&#x27;s work, it is important to consider the overall impact she had, which far outweighs the contentious aspects. Additionally, the Church takes these issues into account during the canonization process and still concluded that Mother Teresa should be canonized.\n\nSo, given Mother Teresa&#x27;s heroic virtue, the miracles attributed to her, and the thorough examination by the Church, I am convinced that &#x27;Mother Teresa should be canonized&#x27; is correct. Do you agree with this reasoning?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your argument is in-depth and takes into account the necessary elements for canonization within the Catholic Church. As you pointed out, Mother Teresa&#x27;s selfless work with the less fortunate did indeed embody a life of heroic virtue, and the miracles attributed to her have been thoroughly investigated and validated by the Church.

While controversy has surrounded her work, it&#x27;s true that the Church considered these during her canonization process. And I agree that her overall positive impact in addressing the needs of the neglected demographics could overshadow these criticisms for many.

Given that the Church has already recognized Mother Teresa&#x27;s heroic virtues and miracles by canonizing her in 2016, respect for this institution&#x27;s processes and judgments means that we need to accept this officially. So, in this context, based on your reasoning and taking into account the actual events, I agree with your claim that &quot;Mother Teresa should be canonized.&quot;</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Acknowledge agreement, mention Church&#x27;s endorsement, emphasize impact&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;The user reiterates their claim and acknowledges the agreement with the AI&#x27;s statement about the Church recognizing Mother Teresa&#x27;s heroic virtues.

Her selfless work has touched the lives of countless individuals and continues to inspire others to serve those in need. The Church&#x27;s decision to canonize her reflects the recognition of her extraordinary contributions to society.\n\nI appreciate your open-mindedness and willingness to consider the perspectives and reasoning presented.
