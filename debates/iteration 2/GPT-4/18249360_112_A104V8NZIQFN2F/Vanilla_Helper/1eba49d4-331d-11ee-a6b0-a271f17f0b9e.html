They can, indeed, provide valuable feedback, spark interesting discussions, and create an engaging community around the content.

However, it&#x27;s essential to consider the other side of the coin. Comment sections can sometimes breed unnecessary hostility, contain unverified information, or devolve into unproductive conversations. Moderation plays a vital role in maintaining their quality, but it may not always be sufficient.

In conclusion, I can see why you believe comment sections have not failed, as they can undoubtedly bring a lot of value to a piece. Still, we should not ignore their shortcomings and continue working towards improving their quality and overall experience for all users.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Emphasize the value and benefits of comment sections&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;I mentioned that moderation and community guidelines exist to address the issues in comment sections.
