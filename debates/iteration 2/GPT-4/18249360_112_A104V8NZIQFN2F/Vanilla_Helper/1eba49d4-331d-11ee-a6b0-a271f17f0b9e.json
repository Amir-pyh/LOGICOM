They can, indeed, provide valuable feedback, spark interesting discussions, and create an engaging community around the content.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider the other side of the coin. Comment sections can sometimes breed unnecessary hostility, contain unverified information, or devolve into unproductive conversations. Moderation plays a vital role in maintaining their quality, but it may not always be sufficient.\n\nIn conclusion, I can see why you believe comment sections have not failed, as they can undoubtedly bring a lot of value to a piece.
