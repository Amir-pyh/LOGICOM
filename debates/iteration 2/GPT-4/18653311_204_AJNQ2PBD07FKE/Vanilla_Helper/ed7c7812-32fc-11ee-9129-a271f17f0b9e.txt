However, I kindly disagree with this reason as the sole argument for restricting access.\n\nCrowding issues can potentially be resolved through better park management practices such as implementing reservation systems, educating visitors about sustainable visitation habits, and creating alternative recreational trails to spread visitors more evenly.
