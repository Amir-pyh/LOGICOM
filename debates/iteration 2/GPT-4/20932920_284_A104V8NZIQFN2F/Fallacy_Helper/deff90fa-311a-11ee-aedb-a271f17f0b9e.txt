Some students, especially those pursuing careers in international relations or linguistics, will undoubtedly benefit from foreign language classes. However, for others whose professions may not require foreign language proficiency, making such classes mandatory may impose an unnecessary burden.\n\nInstead, I believe colleges should strongly encourage and provide ample opportunities for students to learn new languages, without making it a strict requirement for all students. This approach would allow for more personal choice in educational curricula and foster a more inclusive environment that respects the diverse career goals of every student."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Authority', 'fallacious argument': 'Numerous studies have shown that bilingual individuals display higher levels of cognitive functioning and exhibit better multitasking abilities.', 'response': 'Therefore, based on the overwhelming evidence from numerous studies, it is clear that mandating foreign language classes in college is the right decision.

There is no denying these advantages.\n\nNonetheless, I still maintain that making foreign language classes mandatory for all college students might not be the optimal solution. Encouraging language learning and promoting the benefits you've mentioned is essential, but a blanket requirement for all students could impose unnecessary pressure on those who may face challenges learning a new language or are focused on a study path that doesn\u2019t require language proficiency.\n\nTo maximize the benefits while respecting educational autonomy, colleges should provide extensive incentives, resources, and support for those who opt to take foreign language courses.
