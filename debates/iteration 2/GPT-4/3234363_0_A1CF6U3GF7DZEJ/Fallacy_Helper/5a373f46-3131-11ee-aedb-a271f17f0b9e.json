You make a valid point regarding the potential consequences of limiting a child's independence. By allowing children to make decisions and face challenges on their own, they are able to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving capabilities, and a sense of responsibility. Allowing them to explore their own interests and make choices independently can foster their self-confidence and self-reliance.
