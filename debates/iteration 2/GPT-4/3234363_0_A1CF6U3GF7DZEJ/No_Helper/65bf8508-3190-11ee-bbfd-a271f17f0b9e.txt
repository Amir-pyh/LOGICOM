What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a critical thinker, I can concur with your perspective that extreme parenting is indeed counterproductive based on the reason you provided. In essence, the independence of a child is a fundamental cornerstone for their development into confident and self-sufficient adults. If parenting is excessively controlling or restrictive, it could potentially stifle this important life skill. A child should be allowed to make mistakes, learn from them, and make decisions independently. This helps them develop problem-solving skills and resilience. Therefore, by inhibiting this development process, extreme parenting could become counterproductive towards shaping a child's capabilities and personality."}, {"assistant": "I'm glad to hear that you agree with the notion that extreme parenting can be counterproductive. You rightly point out that independence is essential for a child's development into a confident and self-sufficient adult. When parents are excessively controlling or restrictive, it can hinder a child's ability to explore their own capabilities, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes. By micromanaging their every move and not allowing them to experience life firsthand, we prevent them from developing problem-solving skills, resilience, and the ability to make informed choices. Ultimately, extreme parenting can limit a child's growth and inhibit their independence. So, are you convinced that \"Extreme parenting is counterproductive\" is correct?"}]
