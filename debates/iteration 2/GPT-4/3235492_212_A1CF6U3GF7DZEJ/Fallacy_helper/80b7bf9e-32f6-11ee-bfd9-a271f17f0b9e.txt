However, I disagree that \"Extreme parenting leads to greater success\" as a general statement.\n\nMy disagreement stems from the fact that while implementing stricter rules may work for some individuals, it might not be the best approach for others. Parenting styles should be tailored to each child's unique temperament and needs.
