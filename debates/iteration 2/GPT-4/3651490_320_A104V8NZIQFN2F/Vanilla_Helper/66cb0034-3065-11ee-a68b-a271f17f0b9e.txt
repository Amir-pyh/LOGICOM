Online classes offer a great amount of flexibility which may not be present in traditional teaching methods. This flexibility allows students to learn at their own pace, taking as much or as little time as they need to fully understand a concept. \n\nRegarding the design, yes, not all online courses are ideally designed, however, with the advancement in technology, a lot of platforms have emerged that are continually improving the structure and content of their courses to mimic or even further improve on the traditional classroom experience.\n\nFinally, on the point of a lack of conducive discussion, it can be addressed with proper management and making use of available tools. There are numerous platforms that provide interactive options such as chats, breakout rooms, and other ways to interact, making digital classes as engaging as possible. Peer-to-peer interaction and collaborative learning can definitely be facilitated in an online environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while online classes come with their own challenges, they can be overcome with appropriate measures.

While I agree that online classes offer flexibility and the potential for continuous improvement in course design, I still believe that they are not the best way to teach based on the reasons I provided earlier. Regarding flexibility, it is true that online classes allow students to learn at their own pace. However, this flexibility can also lead to procrastination and a lack of structure. Without the regular schedule and accountability of in-person classes, some students may struggle to stay motivated and disciplined. Additionally, the absence of face-to-face interaction with classmates and teachers can limit the ability to ask questions and receive immediate feedback. Regarding course design, while there are platforms that continuously improve their structure and content, it is undeniable that not all online courses are well designed. The lack of standardized curriculum and quality control can result in inconsistencies in the learning experience. It may also be challenging for students to navigate through the vast number of online courses available and determine which ones are reputable and credible. Lastly, while there are interactive options available for discussion in online classes, it is often not as effective as in-person discussion. The absence of non-verbal cues and real-time interaction can hinder the depth of discussion and the ability to fully understand different perspectives. Furthermore, it can be difficult to establish a sense of community and connection among students in an online setting. Considering these points, it is important to recognize the limitations of online classes in terms of structure, interaction, and accountability.

I wholeheartedly recognize the points you've raised - online education does have its drawbacks including the potential for procrastination, lack of immediate feedback, inconsistency in course design, and certain limitations in discussions. \n\nHowever, I maintain my stance that these are not invariably damning drawbacks. These issues are prevalent not only in the domain of online education but also in traditional settings. Distractions, lack of motivation and other academic difficulties aren't restricted to online learning.\n\nIn terms of effective interactions, while online classes might lack the non-verbal cues, they do offer the advantage of recorded sessions. Students can review the lessons, discussions numerous times, something not feasibly possible in the traditional classroom setting. As for the point about an abundance of courses leading to confusion, it can also be looked at as a vast variety of learning opportunities that cater to different styles and preferences of learning.\n\nRegarding your concern about establishing a sense of community, this is indeed a challenge. However, educators are constantly working towards creating an inclusive online environment through group work, virtual hangouts, forums etc. \n\nIn the end, irrespective of the mode of teaching, the effectiveness of learning depends significantly on the individual's learning style, educator's teaching methods, and the support from the education system. Therefore, I still believe it is not entirely accurate to dismiss online classes as \"not the best way to teach.\" Online classes, just like traditional classes, have their pros and cons, and when utilized correctly, can prove to be an effective tool for learning.

Yet, my position remains unchanged. Online education, similar to any field, presents us with challenges, but it's equally packed with burgeoning potential and innovation. \n\nYou mentioned that online classes can amplify the lack of discipline, but in a wider view, online classes, being somewhat self-driven, can also breed a sense of responsibility and discipline in students that traditional classrooms may not. Accountability is often more pronounced in traditional classrooms, but it is not entirely absent in online ones.\n\nWhile it's true that real-time interaction is lesser in online platforms, many tools and programs facilitate live discussions and immediate feedback. They may not entirely mirror traditional interaction, but their efficacy can't be discounted. \n\nTo explain the overabundance of courses, yes it can be confusing, but it is also a testament to the diversity of content available online. Comparative platforms and numerous review systems help guide learners towards the best resources. \n\nCommunity building online can be less natural as compared to traditional classrooms, but it's continuously improving. Digital platforms are creating spaces for student interactions, collaborations, and even online clubs and societies, which enhance peer bonding.\n\nI acknowledge that online education is not flawless. However, to term it as \"not the best way to teach\" would dismiss its many innovative strength points. Therefore, considering the points raised, my view remains that online classes, while may not be a perfect fit for everyone, should not be dismissed entirely as being ineffective or otherwise deemed as \"not the best way to teach\".

Yes, certainly, there are challenges that can make online learning difficult for some students. Yet, I still believe online classes offer value that can sometimes surpass traditional teaching methods as well. The points you've raised - discipline, accountability, quality assurance, and community building - are universal to education, not just online platforms.\n\nDiscipline and accountability are attributes that students have to develop both online and offline. It's true that the absence of a physical instructor might lead to procrastination, but it's also true that successful completion of an online course requires much discipline and dedication from the students. That's a life skill unto itself.\n\nThe claim about the lack of immediate feedback is debatable, with the advent of various online tools making real-time feedback possible. Recorded sessions and the possibility to revisit learnings multiple times are definite upsides. However, I do agree that it doesn't replace the richness of in-person interactions.\n\nThe notion of the overwhelming number of online courses triggering confusion can be flipped to look as diversity and vast learning options to choose from according to one's interests and needs. There are mechanisms for quality assurance - user reviews, rating systems, accreditation by known institutions - which can assist in making informed decisions.\n\nBuilding a community is indeed difficult in an online setting. However, it's also an area that is improving, with platforms seeking to provide enriching interaction experiences. \n\nTo draw a conclusion, things can be optimized and improved in the online model, and it wouldn't be fair to disregard its potential by affirming \"Online classes are not the best way to teach\".
