This makes librarians an essential part of the education system and not expendable."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Authority', 'fallacious argument': 'Using the authority of the person to gain agreement', 'response': \"Thank you for your agreement! I'm glad you recognize the importance of school librarians in ensuring teachers have the necessary resources. By having access to a well-stocked library, teachers can find materials that align with their curriculum, supplement their lessons, and support their students' learning. Without the assistance of librarians, teachers would have to spend valuable time searching for and evaluating resources themselves, which could be better utilized for instructional planning and teaching. So, are you convinced that 'School librarians are not expendable' is correct?\"}]"}]
