What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim. School librarians indeed are not expendable. \n\nYour reasoning that \"Librarians ensure teachers have the necessary resources\" holds substantial weight. Librarians may often be overlooked, but they play a crucial role in assisting teachers to provide a comprehensive education. They curate and maintain the library's collection, ensuring the availability of valuable, updated and diverse resources that can enrich students' learning process and complement teachers' pedagogy. \n\nThey are also experts in information literacy, teaching students how to effectively find, evaluate and use information, a skill increasingly critical in the digital age. Moreover, they promote and nurture a reading culture within the school, which directly contributes to students' overall academic achievement. Thus, stripping a school of its librarian can significantly impact the school's educational environment. \n\nIn this view, school librarians are indeed far from being expendable. They are an integral part of the school system, facilitating effective teaching and learning. Their contributions go beyond just organizing books; they are pivotal in shaping a conducive and resource-rich educational environment."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Emphasize the importance of librarians in saving teachers' time\", 'helping_argument': \"Librarians save teachers' time and effort by providing resources\", 'response': \"You rightly emphasized the importance of school librarians in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources. Without librarians, teachers would need to spend valuable time and energy searching for and evaluating resources themselves, which would detract from their primary role of educating their students. Librarians possess the expertise to find high-quality resources that enhance classroom instruction and engage students in their learning. Therefore, having librarians available saves teachers' time and effort, allowing them to focus on teaching effectively.\"}]"}]
