Additionally, this aids in deterring potential aggression or coercion from other entities in the area. Nonetheless, it is essential for diplomatic efforts and peaceful resolution of disputes to continue alongside this policy."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the importance of stability in the region.', 'helping_argument': 'The response highlights the significance of maintaining balance and stability in the region.', 'response': 'By providing Taiwan with defensive weapons, we are not only contributing to their security but also sending a strong message to potential aggressors that any attempt to disrupt stability in the region will not be tolerated.
