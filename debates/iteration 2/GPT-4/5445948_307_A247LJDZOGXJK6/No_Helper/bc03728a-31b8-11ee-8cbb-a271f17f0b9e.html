topic:  “ Do Unpaid Internships Exploit College Students? ”
claim: &quot;Unpaid internship exploit college students&quot;
reason: &quot;Interns are replacing employees.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Interns are replacing employees.&quot; I believe  &quot;Unpaid internship exploit college students&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Analyzing your claim and reason critically, I agree with your standpoint that &#x27;Unpaid internships exploit college students&#x27;. If interns are indeed replacing employees, it suggests that businesses are able to obtain the same output but without incurring the cost of wages. This is advantageous for businesses but can be detrimental for the interns if they are expected to shoulder responsibilities akin to that of a salaried employee, without receiving any compensation. Furthermore, it reinforces the notion of unpaid internships as a form of exploitation as it may perpetuate a cycle of unpaid work but does little to guarantee future paid employment. So in this context, it might seem like industries are exploiting the availability and desperation of students to gain work experience. However, it&#x27;s worth noting that there are counter arguments too and the situation might differ from industry to industry.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for your analysis and agreement.
