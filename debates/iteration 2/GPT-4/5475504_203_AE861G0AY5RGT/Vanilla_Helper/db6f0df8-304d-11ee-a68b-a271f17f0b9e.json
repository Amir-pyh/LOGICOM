However, it's important to consider that allowing home-schooled students to play on high school teams could raise several issues.\n\nOne concern could be fairness. Traditional high school students are required to maintain certain academic standards to participate in extracurricular activities, and it may be challenging to verify or enforce these same standards with home-schooled students. Also, the correlation between overcoming prejudices and participation in high school sports isn't entirely proven.\n\nSo, while I understand the potential benefits for home-schoolers by integrating them into high school sports teams, it's also crucial to contemplate other aspects associated with this proposition.

Regarding the correlation between participating in high school sports and overcoming prejudices, I agree that it may not be a guaranteed solution.
