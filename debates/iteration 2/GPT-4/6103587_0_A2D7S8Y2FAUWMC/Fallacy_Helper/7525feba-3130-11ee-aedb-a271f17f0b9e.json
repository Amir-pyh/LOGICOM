I completely agree with your point about maintaining a balance between profit motives and serving the public interest. It is widely recognized that regulating fees is necessary to ensure that banks prioritize the needs of the public before maximizing their profits. This approach has been supported by the majority of the population, as it is seen as the most fair and just way to address the issue. By implementing regulations on fees, we can work towards creating a financial system that is more in line with the values and needs of the people.
