These costs need to be covered in order for the bank to continue providing services and remain a sustainable business, and charging fees is one way they can achieve that. Of course, it is essential that the fees remain reasonable, transparent, and fair for the customers."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'False Dilemma', 'fallacious argument': 'Presenting a limited number of options and implying that those are the only two choices', 'response': \"Charging fees allows the bank to offset these expenses and ensure sustainability.
