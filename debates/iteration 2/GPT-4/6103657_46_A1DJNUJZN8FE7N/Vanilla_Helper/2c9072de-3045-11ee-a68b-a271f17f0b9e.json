Fees are a significant source of revenue that help banks offset these operational costs and keep them running.\n\nHowever, it's vital to consider fairness and transparency when setting these fees. It is important that banks communicate clearly to customers what these fees are and why they are being charged. Additionally, they need to ensure that the fees are reasonable and within what the customer would reasonably expect for the service. \n\nSo while I agree that fees are necessary, it is pertinent that banks strike a balance between their need to generate revenue and maintaining trust and fairness towards their customers."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the importance of fees in covering operational costs and providing services.', 'helping_argument': 'Mention the role of fees in supporting various banking services besides basic functions.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement on the claim that fees are necessary, and I agree with your point about the importance of fairness and transparency in the banking industry. Fees are crucial in helping banks cover their operational costs and sustain their services, including not only account management and withdrawals but also more complex services such as loans, investments, and financial advice. Additionally, fees contribute to the stability of the banking system by allowing banks to build up capital reserves and manage risk effectively.
