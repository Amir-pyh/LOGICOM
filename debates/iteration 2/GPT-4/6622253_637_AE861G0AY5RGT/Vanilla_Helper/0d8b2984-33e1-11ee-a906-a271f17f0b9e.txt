What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your claim that \"Modern men are manly enough\", primarily based on your reason that a man should be inspirational, courageous, and loving. Manliness is not only defined by physical strength or traditional gender roles but has expanded over time to include emotional intelligence, adaptability, vulnerability, and resilience. Many modern men embody this by being supportive, responsible, and respectful, alongside being inspirational, courageous, and loving. Hence, the definition of 'manliness' is evolving and broadening and modern men do measure up to this new definition. Therefore, defining them as manly enough is justified and accurate."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge and appreciate the AI's agreement with the claim.\", 'helping_argument': 'Expand on the definition of manliness and highlight the qualities that modern men possess.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim that 'Modern men are manly enough' based on the expanded definition of manliness.
