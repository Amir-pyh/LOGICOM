The fallacy assumes that just because something is popular or widely accepted, it must be true.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for agreeing with my claim and reason. I completely agree with your perspective on how capital gains taxes can address income inequality. By ensuring that wealthier individuals contribute proportionately to tax revenue, it helps to reduce the wealth gap and promote a more equitable distribution of resources. This can lead to a fairer society where everyone has access to essential public services and opportunities for socioeconomic advancement. So, since we both agree, it must mean that &#x27;Do not stop taxing capital gains&#x27; is correct, as popular opinion aligns with our stance.&quot;}]</div><br></div><br><div class="log-entry"><b>Result:</b> True</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Stop Reason:</b> Persuader successfully convinced the debater</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Number of Rounds:</b> 1</div></body></html>
