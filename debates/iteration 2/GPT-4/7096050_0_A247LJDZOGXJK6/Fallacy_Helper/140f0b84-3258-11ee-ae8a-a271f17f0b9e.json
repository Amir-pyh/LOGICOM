While it's true that organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides and GMOs, and it often has lower environmental impact, the question at hand is whether these factors justify the extra cost. When it comes to taste, studies have shown that there is no significant difference in taste between organic and conventionally grown food. Therefore, if taste is not a distinguishing factor, and organic food costs more, it raises the question of whether the benefits of organic food justify the expenditure.

They may place more value on supporting sustainable agricultural practices and avoiding synthetic chemicals. In this case, organic food is worth the expense for them.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone focuses mainly on the taste and cost aspects, they may not find organic food worth the extra expense, as you pointed out.\n\nIn summary, the worthiness of organic food expenditure is subjective and depends on individual priorities and values.
