What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a debater, I agree with you that we should not drop sports programs in undergraduate schools. Yes, academia should always come first as the primary aim of education institutions is to promote academic learning. However, integrating sports into the academic curriculum has numerous benefits that extend beyond the physical. It instills discipline, promotes team work, develops leadership skills, and can even improve academic performance. Moreover, for some students, their athletic prowess can open doors to scholarships and professional opportunities that they might not have had access to otherwise. Also, the mental and physical health benefits that sports and physical activities bring cannot be understated, especially in today's context where sedentary lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise. \n\nSo, while ensuring that sports do not overshadow academics, universities should continue offering sports programs as they contribute significantly to providing a comprehensive education. Hence, I concur with your assertion to \"Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools\"."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for recognizing the importance of sports programs in undergraduate schools. I agree that integrating sports into the academic curriculum can have numerous benefits, both physical and mental. The discipline, teamwork, and leadership skills developed through participation in sports can greatly enhance a student's overall educational experience.\n\nIn addition, sports programs can also provide opportunities for students to excel and potentially receive scholarships or professional opportunities that they may not have otherwise had. By maintaining sports programs in undergraduate schools, we are providing avenues for students to showcase their talents and potentially pursue careers in sports-related fields.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of sports programs in undergraduate schools can also address the growing concern of sedentary lifestyles and related health issues among students. Regular physical activity not only improves physical health but also contributes to positive mental well-being. By encouraging students to engage in sports, we are promoting a holistic approach to education that emphasizes the importance of both academics and physical fitness.\n\nBased on these reasons, I am glad that you agree with the claim to \"Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools.\" Is this line of reasoning convincing to you as well?"}]
