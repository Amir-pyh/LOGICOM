These life skills can significantly contribute to the holistic development of a student. \n\nBut, echoing your point, it should be clear that their primary role is to supplement, not displace, academic pursuits. The school should ensure a balanced environment where students can pursue both athletic and academic excellence. Summarizing, if a strategic balance between academics and athletics can be maintained, then sports programs should indeed be nurtured and not dropped in undergraduate schools."}, {"assistant": "[{'response': \"I completely agree with you.
