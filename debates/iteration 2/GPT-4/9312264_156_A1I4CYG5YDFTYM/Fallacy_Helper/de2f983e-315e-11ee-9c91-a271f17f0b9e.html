Tipping allows customers to show their appreciation for good service and incentivize servers to perform at their best. By tipping, customers are recognizing the effort that a server puts into their job, and it encourages better service in the industry overall. Additionally, tipping can also make up for the often-low wages that servers receive, helping them to earn a more decent income. However, it is important to note that a fair wage system should be promoted, but until that change occurs, tipping becomes a significant part of a server&#x27;s income.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Popular Opinion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Using the widespread acceptance of tipping as evidence for its correctness&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your agreement with the claim &#x27;To tip&#x27; and your understanding of the reasons behind it.
