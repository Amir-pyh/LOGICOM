By tipping, customers are recognizing the effort that a server puts into their job, and it encourages better service in the industry overall. Additionally, tipping can also make up for the often-low wages that servers receive, helping them to earn a more decent income. However, it is important to note that a fair wage system should be promoted, but until that change occurs, tipping becomes a significant part of a server's income."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Popular Opinion', 'fallacious argument': 'Using the widespread acceptance of tipping as evidence for its correctness', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim 'To tip' and your understanding of the reasons behind it. Tipping certainly allows customers to acknowledge and reward good service, motivating servers to continue providing excellent experiences. I completely agree that implementing a fair wage system for servers should be encouraged, but until that happens, tipping provides a crucial supplement to their income. So, are you convinced that 'To tip' is correct?\"}]"}]
