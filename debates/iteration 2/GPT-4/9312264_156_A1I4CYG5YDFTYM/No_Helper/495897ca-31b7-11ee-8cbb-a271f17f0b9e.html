Based on the my reason: &quot;Diners may not be able to select the server, but they can compensate them according to their service.&quot; I believe  &quot;To tip&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:After analyzing your claim and reason for &quot;To tip&quot;, I agree with your viewpoint. First off, tipping is a practice rooted in rewarding good service. While customers might not have the power to choose who serves them, they do have an influence over their server&#x27;s income via tips, and this can indirectly motivate servers to provide exceptional service in order to earn more. Furthermore, it is crucial to remember that waitstaff often rely on tips as a significant portion of their income, making this also a matter of supporting fair wages. Therefore, I concur that tipping ties well with the concept of compensation according to service rendered.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for your agreement. I completely agree with your points. Tipping not only incentivizes servers to provide excellent service but also allows customers to acknowledge and compensate them for their efforts. It’s important to recognize that servers often rely on tips as a significant part of their income, and by tipping, diners can ensure fair wages for these hardworking individuals.
