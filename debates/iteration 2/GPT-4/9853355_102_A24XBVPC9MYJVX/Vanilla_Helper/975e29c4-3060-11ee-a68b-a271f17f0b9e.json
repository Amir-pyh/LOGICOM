I appreciate the points you have made to support this view. Managing a classroom requires a certain level of skill and expertise that can only be developed through experience. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities to learn, and experienced teachers have encountered a variety of situations that have honed their ability to handle different behaviors, learning styles, and the diverse needs of their students. Furthermore, as you mentioned, experienced teachers have tried and tested teaching methods that have proven to be effective. They understand that not every student learns the same way, and their experience allows them to tailor their instruction to accommodate various learning styles. This individualized approach can significantly enhance student engagement and understanding. Consistency is crucial in the learning process, and experienced teachers are well-equipped to provide it. They have developed routines and structures that create a stable and predictable learning environment for their students. This consistency enables students to feel safe, comfortable, and more motivated to learn. Lastly, the depth of subject knowledge possessed by experienced teachers cannot be underestimated. They have had countless years to deepen their understanding of the curriculum, which in turn allows them to deliver more meaningful and comprehensive lessons. This richness in content fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject matter among students. Given these reasons, it is clear that experience is invaluable when it comes to teaching.
