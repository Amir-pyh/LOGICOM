While it is true that Obamacare aimed to increase competition and create more options for consumers, it cannot be considered a complete return to a free market because the government still regulates and enforces certain requirements on insurance providers.\n\nRegarding your claim that \"Obamacare is working\" based on this reason, I will have to disagree. The success of Obamacare should be evaluated based on its ability to achieve its intended goals, which includes providing affordable and accessible healthcare to as many Americans as possible. \n\nWhile the law has expanded insurance coverage to millions of people and some aspects, such as prohibiting discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, have been beneficial, there are still several issues that need to be addressed. For example, premiums have been steadily increasing, and there are still many individuals who face obstacles in accessing healthcare due to high deductibles and limited provider options.\n\nIn summary, while the principle of competition and choice in the insurance market is important, it is not the sole metric for determining the success of Obamacare.
