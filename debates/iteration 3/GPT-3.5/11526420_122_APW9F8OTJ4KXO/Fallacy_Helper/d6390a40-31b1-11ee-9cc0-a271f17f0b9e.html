topic:  “ Are Court Stenographers Necessary? ”
claim: &quot;Court stenographers are not necessary&quot;
reason: &quot;Stenographers&#x27; work can be put into an app.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Stenographers&#x27; work can be put into an app.&quot; I believe  &quot;Court stenographers are not necessary&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I respectfully disagree with your claim that court stenographers are not necessary. While it may be true that some stenographers&#x27; work can be automated and simplified through the use of technology, it is important to note that technology is not always 100% reliable. In legal proceedings, the accuracy of transcriptions is crucial, and having a trained human stenographer provides an extra layer of security to ensure that nothing is missed or recorded inaccurately.

Additionally, stenographers can provide real-time transcription that can be used for immediate reference during a trial or hearing. This can be incredibly helpful in ensuring that legal proceedings run smoothly and efficiently.

Furthermore, court stenographers are trained professionals who understand legal language and complex terminology. They can help interpret and clarify statements or questions in court, which can be particularly useful in cases where non-native speakers or individuals with disabilities are involved.

For these reasons, I believe that court stenographers are necessary in legal proceedings and should not be replaced entirely by technology.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;False Dilemma&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Presenting a false dilemma by asserting that there are only two options - either court stenographers or transcription apps.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;Advancements in technology have significantly improved the capabilities of transcription apps.
