reason: &quot;Stenographers&#x27; work can be put into an app.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Stenographers&#x27; work can be put into an app.&quot; I believe  &quot;Court stenographers are not necessary&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for bringing up this topic for discussion. Considering your reason that stenographers&#x27; work can be put into an app, I respectfully disagree with the claim that court stenographers are not necessary.

While it is true that technological advancements have brought about various changes in the legal field, including the development of transcription software and voice recognition technology, there are several reasons why court stenographers remain essential in court proceedings.

Firstly, court stenographers possess a unique set of skills and expertise. They are trained to transcribe quickly and accurately, ensuring that an official and reliable record of court proceedings is maintained. They have an in-depth understanding of court terminology, legal jargon, and the ability to differentiate between different speakers. This level of precision and attention to detail is essential for legal proceedings where accuracy is crucial.

Secondly, court stenographers play a vital role in real-time transcription. It is not enough for a transcript to be available after the court session has concluded; judges, attorneys, and litigants often require immediate access to a real-time transcription of the proceedings. This allows them to make effective legal arguments, cross-examine witnesses, and respond to evidence promptly. An app may have limitations in providing real-time transcriptions, especially if there are technical issues or interruptions.

Furthermore, court stenographers provide a valuable human element to court proceedings. They are capable of understanding and adapting to the nuances of a trial, such as the tone of voice, emotions, and non-verbal cues that an app might overlook or misinterpret. Stenographers can ask for clarifications from speakers, seek guidance from the judge regarding inaudible statements, and ensure that the record is complete and accurate.

Lastly, it is important to consider access to justice. Not all courtrooms have the resources or infrastructure to implement transcription apps universally. In some cases, relying solely on an app for transcription may inadvertently exclude individuals with hearing impairments or limited English proficiency, who require specialized support, such as stenographers proficient in sign language or capable of accurately transcribing multiple languages.

In conclusion, while advancements in technology have led to the development of transcription software and apps, court stenographers remain necessary in court proceedings. Their expertise, real-time transcription abilities, ability to capture non-verbal cues, and contribution to access to justice cannot be replicated or replaced by an app alone.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for sharing your perspective.
