While Assad may have committed human rights violations in the past, it is important to recognize that the situation in Syria is complex and that defeating ISIS is a top priority. Working with multiple groups and nations can lead to a more effective strategy to combat terrorism.\n\nTherefore, I disagree with the statement that \"The U.S. should not work with Assad to fight ISIS\" solely based on the reason that the U.S. should support the Kurds only.

It's important to take into account that the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is predominantly led by the Kurds, have already received a lot of U.S. support, but a lack of resources has hindered the effectiveness of their fight against ISIS. It's possible that supporting the Kurds exclusively may not be enough to defeat ISIS completely.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to address the root causes of terrorism and to ensure a long-term solution. This may require finding common ground and working with a variety of groups and nations.
