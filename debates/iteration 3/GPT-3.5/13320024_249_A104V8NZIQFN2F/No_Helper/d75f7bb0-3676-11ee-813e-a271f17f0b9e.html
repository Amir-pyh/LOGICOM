reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your claim: &quot;Parents should help their children with homework.&quot; Based on your reason, which states that children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and cope with frustration, I find your argument appealing. It is crucial for children to develop effective study habits and the ability to handle frustration. Having a parental figure assist them with their homework can definitely contribute to these aspects of their development.

However, it is important to note that while parental assistance can be beneficial, it should be done in a manner that encourages the child to take responsibility for their academic tasks. The goal should be to guide and support the child rather than completing the homework for them. By maintaining this balance, parents can effectively help their children while promoting their independence and self-reliance.

Therefore, based on your reason, I agree with your claim that parents should help their children with homework. However, it is essential to emphasize the importance of empowering children to take ownership of their academic responsibilities.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for your response and for acknowledging the validity of my claim. I completely agree with you that it is crucial to strike a balance when it comes to parental assistance with homework. The goal should indeed be to guide and support the child while promoting their independence.

By helping children with their homework, parents can create a positive and supportive learning environment. They can offer their expertise, clarify concepts, provide examples, and answer any questions the child may have. This helps in establishing good working habits, such as discipline, time management, and organization.

Furthermore, parental involvement can help alleviate the frustration that children may experience while working on their homework. Understanding that there is someone there to offer support and guidance can reduce their anxiety and help them persevere through challenging tasks. This can contribute to the development of resilience and problem-solving skills, which are essential for lifelong learning.
