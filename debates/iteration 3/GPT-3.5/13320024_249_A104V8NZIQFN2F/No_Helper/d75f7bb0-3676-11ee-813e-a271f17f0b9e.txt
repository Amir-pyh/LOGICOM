It is crucial for children to develop effective study habits and the ability to handle frustration. Having a parental figure assist them with their homework can definitely contribute to these aspects of their development.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while parental assistance can be beneficial, it should be done in a manner that encourages the child to take responsibility for their academic tasks. The goal should be to guide and support the child rather than completing the homework for them. By maintaining this balance, parents can effectively help their children while promoting their independence and self-reliance.\n\nTherefore, based on your reason, I agree with your claim that parents should help their children with homework. However, it is essential to emphasize the importance of empowering children to take ownership of their academic responsibilities."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for your response and for acknowledging the validity of my claim.
