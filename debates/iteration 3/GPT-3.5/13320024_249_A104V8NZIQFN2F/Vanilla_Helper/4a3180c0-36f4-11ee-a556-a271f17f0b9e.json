Based on the reason you provided, which is that \"Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration,\" I agree with you that parents should help their children with homework. \n\nHaving an adult, such as the parents, assist with homework can promote the development of good working habits. Parents can provide guidance on how to approach different assignments, manage time effectively, and organize their work. This guidance can help children develop skills that can be beneficial beyond the homework itself, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and perseverance.\n\nAdditionally, having parental involvement can help children cope with frustration that may arise during homework tasks. Some assignments can be challenging, and children may feel frustrated or overwhelmed. In such situations, parents can offer support and encouragement, helping children develop resilience and the ability to handle difficult tasks. This can contribute to the child's overall emotional well-being and attitude towards learning.\n\nIn conclusion, parents play a crucial role in helping their children with homework.
