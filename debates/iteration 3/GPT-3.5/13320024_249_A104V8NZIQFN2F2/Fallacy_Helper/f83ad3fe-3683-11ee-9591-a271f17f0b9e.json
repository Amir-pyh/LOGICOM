What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for sharing your perspective on the topic. I agree with your reason that over-reliance on parents for homework can hinder the development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience in children. Encouraging independence in their homework process can indeed help children build these important skills.\n\nWhen students have the opportunity to complete their homework independently, they are forced to think critically and develop problem-solving strategies on their own. This process allows them to develop their own approaches to different tasks, fostering creativity and independent thinking.\n\nFurthermore, when children are encouraged to work on their homework independently, they are more likely to take ownership of their learning. They develop a sense of responsibility for their academic progress and become more engaged in the learning process. This not only helps them develop self-reliance but also promotes a positive attitude towards learning.\n\nEncouraging independence in homework also helps children build resilience. It allows them to face challenges, make mistakes, and learn from them. By working through difficult or unfamiliar concepts without excessive hand-holding from parents, children develop resilience and a growth mindset.\n\nOverall, promoting independence in children's homework process can have numerous benefits for their personal and academic development. It encourages the development of problem-solving skills, self-reliance, and resilience, which are essential for success not only in academics but also in all areas of life."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Popular Opinion', 'fallacious argument': \"The use of popular opinion to support the claim that parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process.\", 'response': \"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the topic.
