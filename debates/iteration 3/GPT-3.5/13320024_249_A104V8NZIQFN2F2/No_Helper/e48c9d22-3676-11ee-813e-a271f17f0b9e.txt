What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for presenting your claim and reason. Based on your reason that over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children's development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience, I agree with the claim that parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process.\n\nIt is essential for children to develop these skills, as they not only contribute to academic success but also play a crucial role in their personal growth and future endeavors. When parents become overly involved in their children's homework, it may prevent them from fully exploring their own capabilities and finding innovative solutions to challenges.\n\nBy encouraging independence, parents allow their children to take ownership of their learning, fostering a sense of responsibility. It empowers them to develop problem-solving skills, as they are required to think critically, make decisions, and find answers on their own. Through this process, they also build resilience by learning to persevere in the face of difficulties and develop confidence in their abilities.\n\nParents can still provide support and guidance, but it is important to strike a balance between assistance and independence. By allowing children to navigate their homework independently, parents can create an environment that promotes growth, instills a sense of accomplishment, and equips children with vital skills that extend beyond their academic life.\n\nTherefore, in agreement with your reason, I believe that parents should indeed encourage independence in their children's homework process."}, {"assistant": "Thank you for your agreement and insightful explanation.

This, in turn, helps them develop problem-solving skills and resilience, which are valuable qualities for success not only in academics but also in various aspects of their lives.\n\nSo, are you now convinced that \"Parents should encourage independence in their children's homework process.\" is correct?"}]
