topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;
reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a professional debater, I will carefully analyze your reason and provide my perspective on the claim. 

You argue that over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience. I completely agree with this reasoning and believe that it supports the claim that parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.

Children need to develop self-reliance and problem-solving skills to become independent learners. If parents constantly intervene or do the work for them, children may become dependent on their parents&#x27; assistance, impeding their ability to think critically and solve problems on their own.

Furthermore, by encouraging independence in the homework process, parents can foster resilience in their children. When children face challenges or difficulties in their assignments, allowing them to struggle and find solutions on their own can help build resilience and a sense of achievement when they overcome obstacles without constant parental guidance.

Overall, by promoting independence in their children&#x27;s homework process, parents can facilitate the development of important skills such as self-reliance, problem-solving, and resilience. Therefore, I agree with your reason and the claim that parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Emphasize understanding of the importance of independence in children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;You argue that over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.
