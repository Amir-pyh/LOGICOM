Firstly, we need to understand that the development of condo buildings can bring economic benefits to a city, such as job creation and increased tax revenue. Additionally, condos can provide affordable housing solutions for people living in crowded urban environments.\n\nHowever, it is also important to acknowledge that developers may prioritize profit over the welfare of the community. This can lead to issues such as gentrification, displacement of low-income residents, and environmental concerns.\n\nTherefore, I would say that while helping condo developers can bring both benefits and drawbacks to a city, it ultimately depends on how the development is approached and regulated. By implementing measures for affordable housing, community involvement and environmental considerations, the potential negative impact of condo development can be mitigated.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I would say that it's not as black and white as just saying that helping condo developers always hurts the city.
