topic:  “ Ultimate Frisbee at the Olympics? ”
claim: &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot;
reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;While it is fun when you are a player, there isn&#x27;t enough to it to entertain an audience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for presenting your view on the issue of &#x27;Do not legitimize Frisbee&#x27;. However, I respectfully disagree with your reasoning and your conclusion. 

I can understand how you may perceive that Frisbee is not a sport that is as exciting to watch as some other popular sports. However, this argument assumes that the primary goal of sports is to entertain an audience. While it is a significant factor in sports today, it is not the sole purpose of sports. 

Frisbee is a unique sport in terms of the physical skills required to play it at a competitive level. It is a sport that requires athleticism, agility, and hand-eye coordination - all of which are qualities that are highly valued in other sports as well. It also encourages teamwork and communication, which are essential skills in any sports team. 

Moreover, the inclusion of Frisbee in the Olympics could help to boost the sport&#x27;s recognition and popularity, leading to more opportunities for players to compete in competitions with better rewards. It could also inspire younger generations to take an interest in the sport, leading to a growth in the Frisbee player community. 

In conclusion, I disagree with your claim that we should not legitimize Frisbee due to its potential inability to entertain an audience. Frisbee is a skill-based sport with unique qualities that can add value to the Olympic Games and the sporting community overall.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;False Dilemma&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Creating a false dilemma by asserting that the choice is between either having Frisbee in the Olympics or providing an entertaining experience for viewers&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your perspective on the matter. While it is true that Frisbee requires physical skills and promotes teamwork, I still hold the belief that not all sports are suitable for large-scale entertainment. The Olympics, as a global event, is known for its ability to captivate and entertain a wide range of audiences. When evaluating whether a sport should be included in the Olympics, it&#x27;s important to consider the overall impact it will have on the audience. Frisbee, while enjoyable for those participating in the game, may not have enough elements to engage spectators who are not personally invested in the sport. The sport lacks the same level of complexity, strategy, and drama that many other Olympic sports offer. If our goal is to provide an entertaining experience for the millions of viewers watching the Olympic Games, it&#x27;s crucial to select sports that have a proven track record of captivating audiences and creating a sense of excitement. Frisbee, unfortunately, may not meet these criteria.So, are you convinced that &#x27;Do not legitimize Frisbee&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for elaborating on your understanding of the issue. While I appreciate your concern for engaging the audience, my position remains unchanged. In my opinion, sports should not be solely judged based on their entertainment value, but also on their value as athletic activities and the impact that they have on the sporting community. 

It&#x27;s true that Frisbee may not have the same level of complexity and drama as other sports, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it should be excluded from the Olympics. By excluding sports like Frisbee, we may be limiting the opportunities for athletes and communities who hold a passion for the sport. 

Furthermore, we cannot always predict how audiences will react to certain sports. In the past, some seemingly less mainstream sports like beach volleyball and rhythmic gymnastics have become incredibly popular during Olympic Games. As the sporting world continues to evolve, it&#x27;s important to consider the possibility that Frisbee could gain popularity in the future as well.

In conclusion, while I respect your opinion, I do not agree that we should not legitimize Frisbee. It is a unique athletic activity that offers a variety of benefits to those who participate in it and should be given an opportunity to grow and evolve as a sport.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Straw man fallacy&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &quot;Misrepresenting AI&#x27;s argument by creating a weaker version of it.&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your perspective and understand your points about the value of sports as athletic activities and their impact on the sporting community.
