What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I am here to analyze your reason for the claim \"Do not legitimize Frisbee,\" specifically that \"While it is fun when you are a player, there isn't enough to it to entertain an audience.\" \n\nI must disagree with this reason. While it is subjective to determine whether or not an activity is entertaining, it is important to note that Frisbee, or Ultimate Frisbee, as you mentioned, has gained considerable popularity over the years. It has successfully attracted a large and dedicated following who find the sport enjoyable to watch.\n\nIt is also worth considering that the Olympics is a platform that aims to showcase a wide variety of sports, including those that may not conform to traditional notions of entertainment. The Olympics serves as an opportunity to promote diversity, both in terms of sports and cultural inclusion. By including Ultimate Frisbee, the Olympics would offer exposure to a different sporting discipline and encourage more people to get involved.\n\nWhile it might not appeal to everyone, it is important not to underestimate the potential of Ultimate Frisbee to captivate and engage an audience, as it has proven to do so among its established fans. In light of this, I would argue that the claim \"Do not legitimize Frisbee\" based on the reason you provided is not well-founded."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlighting the need for entertainment and global appeal', 'helping_argument': 'Pointing out the lack of depth, complexity, and narrative structure of Ultimate Frisbee', 'response': \"I understand your perspective, but let's delve deeper into the concept of entertainment and audience engagement. While Ultimate Frisbee may have gained popularity among its dedicated fanbase, it falls short when compared to other mainstream sports in terms of attracting a wider audience. To legitimize a sport at the Olympic level, there should be a reasonable expectation of global appeal. This is crucial for broadcasting, sponsorship, and sustaining the sport in the long run. Unfortunately, Ultimate Frisbee lacks the depth, complexity, and narrative structure that many popular sports possess. It often fails to generate the same level of excitement and anticipation that other sports do. Considering the limited attention span of modern audiences, it is important to highlight the need for a sport to be entertaining and captivating to watch, not just for the participants themselves, but also for those spectating. Ultimate Frisbee may provide enjoyment for the players, but it does not possess the same level of strategic complexity or dramatic elements that can fully engage viewers. The inclusion of Ultimate Frisbee in the Olympics, under the premise of entertaining an audience, would be unfair to other sports that offer a higher level of competition, spectacle, and storytelling potential. Therefore, based on the reason provided, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is the correct claim.

While it is true that some sports may have broader appeal and higher levels of complexity, I still maintain my disagreement with the claim \"Do not legitimize Frisbee\" based on the reasons provided.\n\nFirstly, it is important to remember that the Olympics aims to represent and showcase a diverse range of sports, not solely those with the highest levels of complexity or global appeal. Inclusion in the Olympics is not solely dependent on attracting a massive audience, but also on the sport's values, growth potential, and the interest it generates worldwide.\n\nWhile Ultimate Frisbee may not possess the same level of strategic complexity or possess the same dramatic elements as some established sports, it is essential to recognize that entertainment value is subjective. What may not captivate one audience may resonate with another. Ultimate Frisbee has shown its ability to attract a loyal and passionate following, and its increasing popularity indicates a demand for its representation at major sporting events.\n\nFurthermore, the narrative potential and excitement of a sport can evolve over time as it gains exposure and established athletes push new boundaries. By introducing Ultimate Frisbee to the Olympics, it opens up opportunities for further development and refinement, enabling it to potentially reach new heights and engage a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the essence of the Olympic Games is to celebrate athleticism, competition, and sportsmanship. In recognizing the dedication and skill of Ultimate Frisbee players, it would be unjust to dismiss their aspirations for inclusion based solely on the premise of entertainment appeal.\n\nTherefore, although I understand your perspective, I am still not convinced that \"Do not legitimize Frisbee\" is the correct claim based on the reasons provided."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Consider the comparative entertainment value and the broad audience appeal', 'helping_argument': \"I appreciate your thoughtful response and acknowledgment of the diverse nature of sports and the values promoted by the Olympic Games.
