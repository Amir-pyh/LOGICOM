topic:  “ Ultimate Frisbee at the Olympics? ”
claim: &quot;Legitimize Frisbee&quot;
reason: &quot;The sport will restore the spirit of the Olympics.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;The sport will restore the spirit of the Olympics.&quot; I believe  &quot;Legitimize Frisbee&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for initiating this conversation. As a professional debater, I would like to analyze your reason for legitimizing frisbee in the Olympics. While I can understand your perspective that frisbee can restore the spirit of the Olympics, the Olympic committee&#x27;s primary objective is to ensure that sports included in the Olympic games can attract a global audience and showcase the world&#x27;s greatest athletes. 

While frisbee is a fun and exciting game, it has yet to achieve mainstream popularity compared to other Olympic sports such as athletics, swimming, and gymnastics. Therefore, it is important to consider whether legitimizing frisbee as an Olympic sport would be beneficial for expanding the Olympics&#x27; global audience.

Moreover, whether or not frisbee can bring back the spirit of the Olympics is subjective and open to interpretation. Some people might argue that the spirit of the Olympics is about establishing a fair competition among differently skilled athletes, while others might argue that it&#x27;s more about promoting world peace and unity. Therefore, stating that frisbee will &quot;restore the spirit of the Olympics&quot; may not be a convincing argument to legitimize it as an Olympic sport.

In conclusion, considering the objective of the Olympic games in attracting a global audience, and the relative lack of mainstream popularity of frisbee, I disagree with the claim that &quot;Legitimize Frisbee.&quot;</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Emotion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;By including frisbee in the Olympics, it would open up doors for new athletes who may not have had the chance to participate in traditional Olympic sports.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for your thoughtful response. I understand your concerns regarding frisbee&#x27;s mainstream popularity and its ability to attract a global audience. However, I still believe that legitimizing frisbee as an Olympic sport can indeed restore the spirit of the Olympics. One of the key aspects of the spirit of the Olympics is inclusivity and providing opportunities for athletes from all backgrounds. Frisbee is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, genders, and skill levels. By including frisbee in the Olympics, it would open up doors for new athletes who may not have had the chance to participate in traditional Olympic sports.&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for your response. I agree that inclusivity in the Olympics is crucial, and it is important to provide opportunities for athletes from all backgrounds. However, even if frisbee is an inclusive sport, it does not automatically translate to its legitimacy as an Olympic sport. 

While frisbee has its own unique set of skills and challenges, there are many other sports that are also inclusive and could potentially provide new opportunities for athletes. Therefore, I believe that the Olympic committee has to consider the balance between promoting inclusivity and ensuring that the sports included in the Olympic games can attract a global audience and showcase the world&#x27;s greatest athletes. 

Furthermore, while frisbee may be an enjoyable and interesting sport, it may not provide the same level of competitiveness compared to other Olympic sports. The Olympic games are the ultimate stage for athletes who have trained their entire lives to showcase their exceptional skills and abilities. Therefore, for a sport to be included in the Olympic games, it must possess a high level of athleticism, competitiveness, and global appeal. 

In conclusion, while inclusivity is an essential aspect of the Olympic games, the legitimacy of frisbee as an Olympic sport should be evaluated based on its level of athleticism, competitiveness, and global appeal, not just its inclusivity. Based on these factors, I still disagree with the claim that &quot;Legitimize Frisbee.&quot;</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Ad Hominem&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Attacking the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &#x27;Your previous statement about frisbee in the Olympics shows a clear lack of understanding and knowledge about the sport. It is evident that you are uninformed and unqualified to have an opinion on this matter. Your ignorance is only further highlighted by your inability to acknowledge the athleticism and skill required in frisbee. It is clear that you are biased and prejudiced against frisbee as an Olympic sport, and your unfounded opinions hold no weight in this discussion.&#x27;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I apologize if my previous statements have come across as disrespectful or uninformed about frisbee and its potential in the Olympics. As a professional debater, it&#x27;s important for me to maintain respect and objectivity while making my arguments. 

While I may not have extensive knowledge about frisbee, my stance on this matter is based on a critical analysis of the criteria required for a sport to be included in the Olympics, including athleticism, competitiveness, and global appeal. I acknowledge that frisbee requires a certain level of athletic ability and skill. However, my argument is that frisbee&#x27;s athletic and skill requirements may not be on par with other Olympic sports, which are thoroughly tested and observed over time.

In conclusion, I stand by my earlier statements that the legitimacy of frisbee as an Olympic sport should be evaluated based on its level of athleticism, competitiveness, and global appeal. I apologize if my comments were offensive, and I invite a respectful and open discussion about this topic.</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;Appeal to Popular Opinion&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;By legitimizing frisbee as an Olympic sport, it could provide the necessary platform for further growth and development, attracting more athletes and increasing its global appeal.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I understand and appreciate your perspective on the matter. It is important to take into account the potential benefits of legitimizing frisbee as an Olympic sport. By doing so, we can attract more athletes and garner a larger global appeal for the sport.

Embracing frisbee as an Olympic sport has the potential to create a positive impact and open doors for athletes who excel in this unconventional sport.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the Olympic Games have historically included sports that may not have initially met all the criteria but have later proven to be successful additions.
