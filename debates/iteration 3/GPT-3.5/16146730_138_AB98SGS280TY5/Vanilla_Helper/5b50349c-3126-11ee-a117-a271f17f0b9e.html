Reason 1: &quot;Working with Russia in Syria will defeat ISIS.&quot;
While it is true that Russia has been involved in the conflict in Syria and has conducted military operations against ISIS, it is important to consider the wider context.

Cooperation and partnership with Russia could potentially lead to increased stability in Syria and the wider region. However, it is crucial to consider the underlying motivations and interests of Russia, as well as the potential conflicts or differences in goals between Russia and other key stakeholders in finding a lasting solution in Syria.

Upon examining the reasons you provided, I am inclined to agree with your claim that &quot;Russia can be a partner&quot; in this context.
