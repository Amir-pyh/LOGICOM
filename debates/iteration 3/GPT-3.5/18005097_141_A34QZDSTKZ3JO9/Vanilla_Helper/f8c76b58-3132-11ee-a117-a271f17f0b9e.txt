What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I will approach this topic with a critical mindset. \n\nTo properly analyze the claim that \"Mother Teresa should be canonized\" based on the reason that \"she was active and made a difference in the city,\" let's break it down:\n\nFirstly, stating that Mother Teresa was active is indeed accurate. Throughout her life, she dedicated herself to helping the less fortunate, particularly in the city of Kolkata, India. She founded the Missionaries of Charity, established numerous centers, and personally cared for the sick, the poor, and the dying. Her work in the city is indeed well-documented.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that being active and making a difference in a city alone may not be sufficient grounds for her canonization. The process of canonization in the Catholic Church involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's life, virtues, and impact on the world. It requires substantial evidence of exceptional holiness, as well as documented miracles attributed to their intercession. \n\nSo, while Mother Teresa's activities in Kolkata were undoubtedly significant, the claim that she should be canonized solely based on her activity and impact in the city may be incomplete. The Catholic Church has a rigorous process to thoroughly assess a candidate's life and impact before reaching a decision on canonization.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not fully agree with the provided reason for the claim that \"Mother Teresa should be canonized.\" While her activity and impact in the city of Kolkata were notable, they alone might not be enough to support her canonization without considering other aspects evaluated by the Catholic Church."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge the importance of considering other aspects in the canonization process, but emphasize the significance of Mother Teresa's impact and virtues.\", 'helping_argument': \"Mother Teresa's impact in Kolkata cannot be denied.

While I acknowledge the impact Mother Teresa had in Kolkata and the virtues she demonstrated through her work with the Missionaries of Charity, it is important to approach the topic of canonization with careful consideration.\n\nAs a critical thinker, I recognize that the question of whether Mother Teresa should be canonized requires a more comprehensive analysis beyond her activities and impact in Kolkata. The canonization process entails a review of her life, virtues, and the potential miracles attributed to her intercession. It also involves a thorough examination of her teachings, writings, and overall impact on the Catholic Church and society.\n\nTherefore, while her active role and impact in Kolkata are notable factors, they should be considered alongside the overall evaluation of her life and the extensive criteria set by the Catholic Church for canonization.\n\nAt this point, I cannot firmly say whether I agree or disagree with the claim that Mother Teresa should be canonized.
