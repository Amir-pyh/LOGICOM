As a professional debater, I would like to critically analyze your reason and respond accordingly. \n\nWhile it is true that individuals with concealed carry permits have gone through some level of background check, it is important to consider that this background check may not be comprehensive enough to thoroughly evaluate someone's character and competence, especially in the context of a college campus. Additionally, there is no guarantee that these individuals will always act in a responsible and safe manner when carrying a concealed weapon on campus.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of guns on a college campus can create a sense of fear and intimidation among students, which can have a negative impact on their academic performance and mental well-being. In fact, research has shown that the mere presence of guns can increase aggression and hostility in certain situations.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I disagree with your reason and claim that guns should not be permitted on college campuses.
