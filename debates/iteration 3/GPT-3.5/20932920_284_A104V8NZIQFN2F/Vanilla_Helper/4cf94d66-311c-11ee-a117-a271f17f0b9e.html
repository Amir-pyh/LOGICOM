Based on the my reason: &quot;We should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak english.&quot; I believe  &quot;Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Thank you for initiating this debate on whether foreign language classes should be mandatory in college. I will analyze your reason for the claim and provide my perspective on it.

Your reason for supporting the claim is that &quot;we should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak English.&quot; Based on this reason, you believe that by making foreign language classes mandatory, colleges can help students develop a proficiency in languages other than English, which is essential in a globalized world.

I agree with your reasoning that learning other languages can be beneficial. In today&#x27;s interconnected world, being able to communicate in multiple languages can open up various opportunities both personally and professionally. Proficiency in a foreign language allows individuals to interact with people from different cultures, understand diverse perspectives, and engage in international collaboration.

Furthermore, learning a new language enhances cognitive skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and multitasking abilities. It helps individuals acquire a deeper understanding of their own language and culture, as well as fosters empathy towards others.

Moreover, requiring foreign language classes in college can contribute to a well-rounded education. By exposing students to different languages and cultures, it promotes global awareness and tolerance, which are increasingly important in today&#x27;s diverse societies.

Nevertheless, while I agree with your reason, I also acknowledge the need to consider potential counterarguments. Some individuals may argue that mandating foreign language classes restricts personal choice and might not align with every student&#x27;s academic or career goals. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of language proficiency and respecting individual academic trajectories.

In conclusion, I agree with your reason that &quot;we should be able to speak other languages rather than expect everyone else to speak English.&quot; By making foreign language classes mandatory in college, students can gain linguistic proficiency, develop valuable cognitive skills, and foster global awareness. However, it is essential to consider individual preferences and ensure a balanced curriculum that respects diverse academic goals.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge counterarguments and address them.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &quot;To address the potential concern regarding restricting personal choice, I would argue that making foreign language classes mandatory in college does not necessarily limit students&#x27; options.&quot;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;To address potential concerns about restricting personal choice, I would like to emphasize that making foreign language classes mandatory in college does not necessarily limit students&#x27; options. Instead, it expands their horizons and allows them to explore new languages and cultures that they may not have otherwise considered.

It enables students to engage with literature, research, and resources in different languages, broadening their knowledge base and enabling them to contribute to global academic discussions.In conclusion, I believe that making foreign language classes mandatory in college provides significant benefits for students in both personal and professional aspects.
