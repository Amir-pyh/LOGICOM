It is important for children to learn how to make decisions, take responsibility for their actions, and learn to persevere through challenges. Overly strict or controlling parenting styles can hinder a child's development of these skills, leading to a lack of confidence and independence. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all parenting style, and what works for one family may not work for another. It is also possible for parents to balance structure and discipline with allowing their children to have some autonomy and decision-making power. \n\nOverall, I agree with the statement that extreme parenting is counterproductive, but it is important to consider the nuances of each individual family and their needs."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Straw Man', 'fallacious argument': \"Misrepresenting the opponent's argument to make it easier to attack\", 'response': \"However, when we refer to extreme parenting, we are specifically referring to parenting styles that are excessively strict, controlling, and overprotective.
