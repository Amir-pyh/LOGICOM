What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for presenting your claim that extreme parenting is counterproductive because it limits a child's ability to be independent. I will now analyze this reason and provide my opinion on whether I agree or disagree with it.\n\nUpon evaluating the statement that extreme parenting limits a child's ability to be independent, I find it to be a valid concern. In extreme parenting, parents often exert overly strict control, minimizing a child's opportunities for decision-making and independence. This can lead to a lack of self-confidence and the inability to navigate life's challenges autonomously.\n\nIt is crucial for children to develop independence as they grow older, as it fosters resilience, problem-solving skills, and self-reliance. By providing space for children to make decisions and learn from their own mistakes, parents can empower them to develop these essential life skills.\n\nIn light of this analysis, I agree with the reasoning provided by the user that extreme parenting is counterproductive due to its potential to limit a child's ability to be independent. It is essential for parents to strike a balance between guidance and allowing room for their children to learn and grow independently."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlight the benefits of independence and personal growth.', 'helping_argument': 'Emphasize the positive outcomes of allowing children to make decisions and learn from their mistakes.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the reasoning that extreme parenting can limit a child's ability to be independent, as it hinders their personal growth and resilience.
