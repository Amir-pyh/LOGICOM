While it is true that the implementation of bike lanes has caused some parking issues, the benefits of having bike lanes far outweigh the drawbacks. Bike lanes have increased safety for cyclists, reduced traffic congestion, and improved air quality.

Cyclists tend to spend more money than drivers on small businesses, as they are more likely to stop and explore their surroundings.
