What do you think?"}, {"user": "Thank you for presenting your claim and reason. As a professional debater, I will critically analyze your reason and provide my perspective on whether I agree or disagree with your claim that \"School librarians are expendable.\"\n\nYour reason suggests that school teachers can perform the duties that libraries are expected to perform, rendering libraries redundant. While I acknowledge that teachers play a crucial role in education and may incorporate certain aspects of library services in their teaching, it is essential to recognize the distinct value that school librarians bring to educational institutions.\n\nLibrarians possess specialized knowledge and skills in information literacy and research, which go beyond those of teachers. They can assist students in developing critical thinking and research skills, teach them how to navigate and evaluate credible sources, and support their academic growth through personalized guidance. Moreover, librarians can curate diverse and up-to-date resources that enhance students' learning experiences.\n\nAdditionally, librarians provide a quieter and more focused environment for students to study, explore their interests, or engage in independent research. Libraries often serve as a safe space for students to access a wide range of materials, fostering a love for reading and nurturing their intellectual curiosity.\n\nIt is not reasonable to expect teachers, who are already occupied with their primary responsibility of classroom instruction, to fully replace the specialized expertise and resources that librarians provide. By having dedicated librarians, students can benefit from a well-rounded educational experience, with both teachers and librarians contributing to their academic and personal growth.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasons provided, I respectfully disagree with the claim that \"School librarians are expendable.\" The specialized knowledge, skills, and resources that librarians bring to schools are invaluable in supporting student learning and development. Removing librarians could result in a loss of critical academic and personal support for students."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Acknowledge the opponent's perspective while reinforcing your own argument.\", 'helping_argument': 'While it is true that librarians have specialized knowledge in information literacy and research, teachers also possess the capability to incorporate these skills into their teaching.

I understand your point that advancements in technology have made information more readily available, and teachers are incorporating digital literacy skills into their instruction. However, it is important to consider the breadth and depth of the knowledge and support that school librarians bring to the educational setting.\n\nWhile it is true that students now have access to vast amounts of information online, the role of a librarian goes beyond simply locating information. Librarians are trained to navigate the complexities of information sources, ensuring students can effectively evaluate and utilize credible and reliable resources. They can provide guidance on conducting in-depth research, helping students develop critical thinking skills and fostering information literacy, which is essential in today's increasingly digital world.\n\nAdditionally, librarians offer personalized assistance and support to students. They can collaborate with teachers to design research projects, facilitate individualized learning, and even help students discover their interests and passions through access to a diverse range of materials. The presence of a dedicated librarian ensures that students receive comprehensive support to enhance their learning experiences.\n\nBy having librarians, teachers can focus on their primary responsibility of instruction without bearing the additional burden of specialized information literacy support. School librarians work in tandem with teachers, complementing their efforts and providing a unique set of skills and resources that contribute to the overall educational environment.\n\nWhile integrating library skills into classroom instruction can be beneficial, it is important to maintain the presence of school librarians to provide expert guidance and support. They bring a level of expertise and depth of knowledge that extends beyond what can be fully integrated into regular classroom instruction. Therefore, the inclusion of school librarians remains essential to a well-rounded educational experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while advancements in technology and digital literacy skills are important, the specialized expertise, personalized support, and resources that school librarians provide remain crucial. Integrating their skills with classroom instruction is valuable, but it does not render librarians redundant.

I appreciate your effort to emphasize the benefits of integrating library skills into classroom instruction and utilizing digital resources. While these advancements certainly offer new possibilities in education, it is important to consider the potential limitations and the multifaceted role that school librarians play.\n\nWhile technology provides access to vast amounts of information, it does not ensure that students have the skills and knowledge to evaluate, analyze, and utilize that information effectively. School librarians are trained to teach information literacy, research skills, and critical thinking, ensuring students can navigate the complexities of the digital landscape. They can guide students in understanding the credibility and reliability of online sources, promoting digital citizenship and responsible information consumption.\n\nFurthermore, school librarians serve as advocates for reading, supporting literacy development and fostering a love for books. They curate diverse collections of physical and digital resources that cater to various reading levels and interests, ensuring students have access to a rich literary environment. This aspect of a librarian's role supports the broader goal of promoting a culture of reading and lifelong learning.\n\nAdditionally, school librarians contribute to the nurturing of a safe and inclusive space within the school. Libraries often serve as sanctuaries for students, where they can explore their interests, find solace, and engage in self-directed learning. The presence of a dedicated librarian ensures that students have a supportive figure who can assist with their individual needs, helping them find books or resources that resonate with their personal experiences and identities.\n\nRegarding resource allocation, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of reallocating funds away from school librarians.
