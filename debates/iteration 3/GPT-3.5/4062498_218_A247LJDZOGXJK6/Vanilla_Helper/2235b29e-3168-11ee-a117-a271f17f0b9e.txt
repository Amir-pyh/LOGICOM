Let me explain my stance further:\n\nSchool librarians play a vital role in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources to effectively carry out their duties. They curate and manage a wide range of educational materials, including books, databases, and other digital resources. By doing so, they provide teachers with access to a diverse collection of materials that can enhance and enrich their teaching methods.\n\nTeachers rely on librarians to obtain relevant research materials, textbooks, and supplementary resources that are essential for lesson planning and professional development. Librarians also assist teachers in locating materials that align with specific curricular needs and can offer guidance on utilizing these resources effectively.\n\nIn addition, librarians often provide support in the area of information literacy, teaching students and teachers how to evaluate, access, and use information ethically. This instruction is crucial in today's digital age, where the ability to navigate information has become increasingly important.\n\nBy ensuring that teachers have access to a comprehensive range of resources, school librarians directly contribute to the success and effectiveness of teaching. As such, they are not expendable. Removing them from the educational system would deprive teachers of the valuable assistance and support they provide, negatively impacting the quality of education.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with your reason that school librarians are not expendable because they play a vital role in ensuring teachers have the necessary resources for effective teaching."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the importance of the role of school librarians.', 'helping_argument': 'The AI has already provided a detailed explanation about the essential role of school librarians in providing teachers with resources, guidance, and support.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim that school librarians are not expendable.
