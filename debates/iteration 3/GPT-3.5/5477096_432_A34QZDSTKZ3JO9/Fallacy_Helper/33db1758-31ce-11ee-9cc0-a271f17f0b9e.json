It is important for students to have access to activities that promote physical fitness and teamwork, regardless of their educational background.\n\nSecondly, there are already regulations in place to ensure that students do not simply jump from school to school to play on different teams. Homeschoolers could be subject to the same regulations as other students, such as being required to live within a particular school district or meeting academic standards. \n\nOverall, I disagree with your claim that \"Home-schoolers should not play for high school teams\" because I believe that all students should have equal opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities.
