I can understand why you think that \"We need more advice about eating well\" is important, considering that some children are not being taught how to cook at home and schools have removed home economics from their curriculums.\n\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with your claim. There are already plenty of resources available for individuals to learn about eating well, such as nutrition experts, online articles, blogs, books, and cooking classes. Additionally, it's important to note that education about healthy eating habits should ultimately start at home, with parents taking on the responsibility to teach their children. \n\nFurthermore, some may argue that the issue isn't necessarily a lack of advice on eating well, but rather a lack of accessibility or affordability to healthy food options in certain areas. In those cases, simply providing more advice on eating well would not address the root issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that it's important to promote healthy eating habits, I do not believe that we need more advice specifically.

By reintroducing these subjects or increasing the emphasis on them, we can provide essential knowledge and skills to young individuals who may not have access to such education outside of school.So, considering the circumstances where some kids are not taught by parents how to cook, and many schools have done away with home economics, do you see the importance and validity of the claim that 'We need more advice about eating well'?\"}]"}, {"user": "Thank you for providing additional information on the importance of promoting healthy eating habits for children.

It simply empowers them with more knowledge and options to make informed decisions based on their unique preferences, cultural backgrounds, and health conditions.
