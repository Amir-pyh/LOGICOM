In competitive sports, allowing doping would give an unfair advantage to those athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs. This is because not all athletes have the same access or willingness to use these drugs, leading to an uneven playing field.\n\n2. Doping can have serious health consequences for athletes, which can affect them not only in the long term but also in the short term. It is not just a personal choice, as the effects of drugs can affect others as well.\n\n3. Doping goes against the spirit of sportsmanship, integrity, and fair play, which are the values that any competitive sport should promote. Allowing doping would undermine the very essence of what sports represent.\n\nWhile it is tempting to argue that athletes should have the freedom to make choices about their health and well-being, we must also consider the impact doping has on the integrity of sports and the safety of athletes.
