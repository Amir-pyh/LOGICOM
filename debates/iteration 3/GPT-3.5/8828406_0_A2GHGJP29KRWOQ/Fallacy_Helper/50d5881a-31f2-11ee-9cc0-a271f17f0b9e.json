While academics should indeed be the primary focus in undergraduate schools, sports programs can also offer many benefits to students.\n\nFor example, participating in sports can promote physical health and team-building skills, which can help students become well-rounded individuals. Additionally, sports programs can provide a sense of community and school spirit, which can foster a positive educational environment and ultimately enhance academic performance.\n\nHowever, some may argue that sports programs can be expensive and can divert resources away from academic programs. It is important to weigh these potential drawbacks against the benefits of sports programs.\n\nOverall, it is important to strike a balance between academics and extracurricular activities such as sports. Therefore, I agree with the claim that we should not drop sports program in undergraduate schools, with the caveat that we should ensure that academics remain the primary focus."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Popular Opinion', 'fallacious argument': 'By maintaining a focus on academics while keeping sports programs, we can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for future success.', 'response': \"It's evident that the overwhelming majority of people agree that maintaining sports programs in undergraduate schools is absolutely essential. The consensus among experts, educators, and parents is that students who participate in sports not only have improved academic performance but also experience exponential personal growth. Countless studies and surveys, conducted nationally and internationally, unequivocally conclude that sports contribute to students' physical and mental well-being. Ignoring this widespread support and contemplating the discontinuation of sports programs would be an irrational and detrimental decision.
