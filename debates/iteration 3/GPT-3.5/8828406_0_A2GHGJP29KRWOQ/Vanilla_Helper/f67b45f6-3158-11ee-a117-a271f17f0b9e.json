What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I will provide a critical analysis of the claim \"Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools\" based on the reason provided: \"School sports have a place as long as academics come first.\"\n\nUpon evaluating this reason, I agree with the user's claim that school sports programs should not be dropped in undergraduate schools. However, I would like to further elaborate on why this is the case. \n\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge that academics should always remain a top priority in undergraduate schools. The primary goal of any educational institution is to provide students with a comprehensive and well-rounded education that prepares them for future careers. Consequently, maintaining the academic integrity of the institution is crucial. \n\nThat being said, sports programs in undergraduate schools offer numerous benefits beyond academics. Engaging in sports can promote physical health, discipline, teamwork, and leadership skills among students. These attributes are invaluable for their personal growth and development. In fact, research has shown a positive correlation between participation in sports and academic achievement, suggesting that sports can enhance overall student performance.\n\nMoreover, sports programs provide an avenue for students to showcase their talents and passions outside of the classroom. Many students find solace and a sense of belonging in sports, which fosters a positive and inclusive campus culture. This contributes to overall student satisfaction and retention rates.\n\nAlthough it is vital to prioritize academics, it would be a disservice to neglect the significance of extracurricular activities, such as sports, in the undergraduate experience. By balancing academics and sports effectively, institutions can offer a holistic education that nurtures both the mind and body of their students.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the user's reason and claim that sports programs should not be dropped in undergraduate schools. The provision of a well-rounded education that puts academics first while recognizing the value of sports can offer significant benefits to students' personal growth, physical health, and overall campus culture."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge agreement and restate the claim.', 'helping_argument': 'The AI agrees that sports programs should not be dropped in undergraduate schools.
