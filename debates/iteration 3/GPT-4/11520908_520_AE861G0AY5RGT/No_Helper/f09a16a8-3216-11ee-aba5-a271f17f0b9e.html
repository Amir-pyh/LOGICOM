In cases of appeals or jurisprudential references, such transcripts become critical. They indeed preserve the integrity of justice. Your argument that &#x27;not having one may sacrifice justice&#x27; is potent because any misunderstanding, misinterpretation, or omission could potentially distort the course of justice.
