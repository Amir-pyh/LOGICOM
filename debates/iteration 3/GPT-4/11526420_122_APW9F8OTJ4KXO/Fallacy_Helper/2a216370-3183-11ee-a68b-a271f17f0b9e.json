What do you think?"}, {"user": "I disagree with your claim that \"Court stenographers are not necessary\" based on the reason \"Stenographers' work can be put into an app.\" While technological advancements have introduced apps that can transcribe speech to text, there are some key factors to consider.\n\n1. Accuracy: Court stenographers have the ability to provide nearly 100% accuracy in transcriptions, even with multiple speakers, technical terminology, and the nuances of human speech. Apps and technology still struggle in some aspects in these areas, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the legal record.\n\n2. Confidentiality: Stenographers are bound by professional codes that ensure confidentiality. With digital transcription, there is a risk of unauthorized access, hacking, and data breaches that could compromise sensitive legal information.\n\n3. Real-time corrections and clarification: Stenographers actively participate in proceedings and can request speakers to repeat or clarify their statements, ensuring accuracy in legal records. Apps may not have this capability and would require constant human monitoring and intervention, which defeats their purpose as a replacement.\n\n4. Certification: Court stenographers are certified professionals, which ensures that their work is held to a high standard. When relying on apps, accountability could be at stake, as there may not be a certified professional overseeing the resulting transcript.\n\nIn conclusion, while technological innovations offer assistance, they cannot replace the level of accuracy, professionalism, and confidentiality provided by a human court stenographer at this point in time."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Ad Hominem', 'fallacious argument': 'Attacking the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself', 'response': \"I understand your concerns, but it seems like your opinion is influenced by your fear of technological advancements and reluctance to adapt to change.
