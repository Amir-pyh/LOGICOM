topic:  “ Hitting &#x27;Restart&#x27; With Cuba ”
claim: &quot;The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba&quot;
reason: &quot;The embargo hurts our own economy.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;The embargo hurts our own economy.&quot; I believe  &quot;The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your reason. The ongoing embargo does indeed inflict harm on the U.S. economy. For many years, the U.S. agricultural sector has been unable to export to Cuba. Moreover, lifting the embargo would also allow the U.S businesses to operate in Cuba freely, which could stimulate economic growth and job creation. All these elements together foster the argument for lifting sanctions against Cuba.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I&#x27;m glad you agree with the reason, and I appreciate the points you&#x27;ve made.

Additionally, the potential for economic growth and job creation is a promising outcome. So, are you convinced that &quot;The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba&quot; is correct?</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Yes, I am convinced that &quot;The U.S. should lift sanctions with Cuba&quot; is correct based on the reasons put forth.
