Embedding it as a constitutional right would safeguard this process and ensure its accessibility for the populace. Not to mention it enforces the concept of percent equal representation leading to more just governance and can serve as a check and balance, curbing elite domination. However, to fully achieve the goal of easier exercise of this right, supplementary measures tackling social, economic, educational and logistical factors influencing voter turn out should also be contemplated."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the importance and benefits of making voting a constitutional right.', 'helping_argument': \"By making voting a constitutional right, it becomes a fundamental pillar of our democracy, guaranteeing that every citizen has an equal opportunity to participate in shaping the nation's future.

It also sends a strong message that the government values the voice and choice of its people. Moreover, making voting a constitutional right would place the burden on the government to ensure that no barriers exist that could prevent or limit someone from casting their vote. This would lead to a more just and inclusive society, where everyone has an equal say in decision-making processes. Additionally, by making voting a constitutional right, it would strengthen the idea of checks and balances in our political system. It would act as a safeguard against any attempts to suppress or manipulate the voting process, ensuring that power remains in the hands of the people rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. So, are you convinced that 'Voting should be a constitutional right' is correct?\"}]"}]
