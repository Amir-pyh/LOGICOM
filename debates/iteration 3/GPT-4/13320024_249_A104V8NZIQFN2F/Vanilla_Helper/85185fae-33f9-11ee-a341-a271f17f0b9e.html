topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;
reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I do agree with your claim that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot; but with certain limitations. Yes, your reason that &quot;Children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration&quot; is valid. Children can yield more productivity, organization, and learning efficiency under adult guidance.

Nevertheless, I propose the importance of enabling self-learning and problem-solving abilities in children. If parents intervene excessively in their children&#x27;s homework, it may lead to dependency and hamper their capability of discovering and learning autonomously. 

Hence, parental involvement should be more about guiding their children with effective studying strategies, helping them plan their time effectively, or providing an encouraging environment for studying, rather than solving tasks and providing direct answers. That way, we aim to cultivate life-long learning skills which are beneficial beyond the scope of homework.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Strike a balance between guidance and independence.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;By offering emotional support and guidance, parents can help children develop resilience and perseverance.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for your response. I understand your concern about fostering self-learning and problem-solving abilities in children. It is important to strike a balance between providing guidance and encouraging independence. By helping children with homework, parents can play a crucial role in teaching them good working habits. Parents can assist in creating a positive study environment that promotes focus and concentration. Additionally, parents can guide children in managing their time effectively, setting goals, and breaking down tasks into manageable steps. Parents can also provide support by helping their children navigate their frustrations and challenges during homework. By offering emotional support and guidance, parents can help children develop resilience and perseverance, which are essential qualities for success in both academics and life. While it is important for children to develop independent learning skills, having an adult figure to provide guidance and support can enhance their learning experience. This support can help children build confidence, develop a solid foundation in academic subjects, and instill a love for learning. So, based on the reason that children need an adult to help them learn good working habits and help with their frustration, are you convinced that &#x27;Parents should help their children with homework&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I appreciate your detailed response and definitely acknowledge that parents can make a vital difference in a child&#x27;s academic development by providing emotional, motivational, and methodological guidance. 

Nevertheless, my stance remains consistent that it&#x27;s crucial to maintain a balance. Parents can contribute to a child&#x27;s efficiency and alleviate their frustrations, but they also need to foster a certain level of independence in children. Support them when needed, but refrain from micromanaging their work. 

Drawing strategies, time-planning, goal-settings, assisting with emotional challenges, and creating a positive study environment are all duties that I agree parents can and should take up. However, rather than directly involving themselves in solving the problems posed by the homework, these tasks should revolve more around preparing the child to tackle the homework on their own.

So, I agree to a certain degree with your claim that &quot;Parents should help their children with homework,&quot; but with the distinction that this help should be geared more towards nurturing independence and critical thinking in the children, rather than simply getting the homework done.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge the perspective and maintain agreement, then reinforce the importance of fostering independence and critical thinking skills.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Maintaining a balance is crucial when it comes to parental involvement in homework.

With the clarification in understanding the manner of parental help, I do agree with the statement &quot;Parents should help their children with homework&quot;. When parents provide an environment and the tools that encourage self-directed learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking, their assistance is indeed very valuable.
