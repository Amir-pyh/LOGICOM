topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;
reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim and reasoning that &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; By encouraging independence, parents are helping to fortify important skills in their children such as self-efficacy, problem-solving, and resilience. 

Over-dependence on parents or adults in completing homework may curb these skill sets. Also, it should be the child&#x27;s responsibility to complete their own homework. This does not mean parents must be entirely detached. They can provide a supportive environment, offer resources, and guide when their children ask for help. But primary responsibility lies with the children. This way they can learn to manage their time, tasks, and tackle challenges independently. 

Moreover, fostering independence in the homework process can increment a student&#x27;s academic confidence and prepare them for the prospects of future education or work environments where self-reliance is indispensable. Therefore, I concur with your assertion and its reasoning.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: Thank you for agreeing with the claim and reasoning. I appreciate your perspective. It&#x27;s crucial for children to develop important skills such as self-efficacy, problem-solving, and resilience through their homework process. By encouraging independence, parents can promote the growth of these skills and empower their children to take responsibility for their own learning.

Creating a supportive environment where parents are available to offer resources and guidance when needed is a balanced approach. It allows children to develop their problem-solving abilities and learn how to manage their time and tasks, which are vital skills for their educational and professional journey.

As you mentioned, fostering independence in the homework process can also boost a student&#x27;s confidence and prepare them for future academic or work environments where self-reliance is essential. By allowing children to experience the satisfaction and accomplishment that comes from completing tasks on their own, parents are setting them up for success in the long run.
