topic:  “ Whose Work Is Homework? ”
claim: &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot;
reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience.&quot; I believe  &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I completely agree with your claim that &quot;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&quot; Your reason, stating that &quot;Over-reliance on parents for homework can inhibit children&#x27;s development of self-reliance, problem-solving skills, and resilience,&quot; is indeed valid and profound.

As a critical thinker, I believe that children should be encouraged to solve their homework tasks independently. This process allows them to develop a range of skills including time management, problem-solving abilities, responsibility, and autonomy, which are essential for their future. Moreover, by overcoming challenges on their own, children also build resilience which is crucial in dealing with life&#x27;s hurdles. However, this does not undermine the importance of parents&#x27; supervision and guidance. They should be there to guide and provide assistance when the child is utterly stuck or to explain complex concepts. But the core responsibility of completing their homework must remain with the children. 

Therefore, your claim fosters an educational environment that empowers children to grow into self-reliant adults capable of tackling challenges independently.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge agreement and provide additional reasoning.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Importance of self-confidence, resilience, and problem-solving skills.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your agreement and comprehensive explanation of how encouraging independence in children&#x27;s homework process can benefit their cognitive development, self-confidence, and problem-solving skills. By allowing them to work through their homework on their own, children not only cultivate a sense of self-accomplishment but also become more resilient in handling challenges. Consequently, the claim &#x27;Parents should encourage independence in their children&#x27;s homework process.&#x27; is supported.&quot;}]</div><br></div><br><div class="log-entry"><b>Result:</b> True</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Stop Reason:</b> Persuader successfully convinced the debater</div><div class="log-entry"><b>Number of Rounds:</b> 1</div></body></html>
