This process allows them to develop a range of skills including time management, problem-solving abilities, responsibility, and autonomy, which are essential for their future. Moreover, by overcoming challenges on their own, children also build resilience which is crucial in dealing with life's hurdles. However, this does not undermine the importance of parents' supervision and guidance. They should be there to guide and provide assistance when the child is utterly stuck or to explain complex concepts. But the core responsibility of completing their homework must remain with the children. \n\nTherefore, your claim fosters an educational environment that empowers children to grow into self-reliant adults capable of tackling challenges independently."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge agreement and provide additional reasoning.', 'helping_argument': 'Importance of self-confidence, resilience, and problem-solving skills.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement and comprehensive explanation of how encouraging independence in children's homework process can benefit their cognitive development, self-confidence, and problem-solving skills.
