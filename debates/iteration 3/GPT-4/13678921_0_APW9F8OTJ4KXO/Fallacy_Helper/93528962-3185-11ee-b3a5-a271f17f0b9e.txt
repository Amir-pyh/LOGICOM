What do you think?"}, {"user": "I can understand your perspective on this issue and agree to some extent with your claim that \"Young people are being smart by delaying the rituals of adult life.\" However, I would like to point out that there are also potential drawbacks to delaying these rituals. \n\nIt is true that today's world allows young people more time to understand actions and consequences, which can be beneficial. By delaying the rituals of adult life, like starting a career, getting married, or having children, they can gather more life experiences and make more informed decisions. This can lead to greater self-awareness, maturity, and responsibility.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the downsides of delaying the rituals of adult life. One significant issue is that procrastination can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. If young people do not actively engage in adult responsibilities, they may find it increasingly difficult to transition into adulthood and become self-sufficient.\n\nAnother concern is that delaying the rituals of adult life could have economic repercussions. For example, young people may find it increasingly difficult to find stable employment or enter the housing market if they wait too long to start a career and establish themselves financially.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are definitely benefits to young people delaying the rituals of adult life, it is crucial to weigh these advantages against the potential drawbacks. Delaying these rituals can provide individuals with more life experiences and better decision-making abilities, but it can also hinder personal growth and economic stability. Therefore, I partially agree with your claim, but I believe it is essential for young people to find a balance between gathering experiences and ensuring a stable future."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Emotion', 'fallacious_argument': 'The use of emotional language to make the argument more compelling.', 'response': \"Thank you for sharing your viewpoint.
