topic:  “ Do Immigrants Take Jobs From American-Born Workers? ”
claim: &quot;The threat has been ignored&quot;
reason: &quot;American born workers are in competition for the same jobs as immigrants, also their US born children who receive affirmative action preferences.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;American born workers are in competition for the same jobs as immigrants, also their US born children who receive affirmative action preferences.&quot; I believe  &quot;The threat has been ignored&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I disagree with the claim that &quot;The threat has been ignored,&quot; based on your reason. While it&#x27;s true that American-born workers and immigrants may compete for the same jobs, most research indicates that immigration has a minimal overall impact on the job market. Additionally, affirmative action policies aim to provide an equal playing field for all, which benefits not only immigrants but also other marginalized communities. Focusing on the threat aspect tends to oversimplify a complex issue.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;fallacy&#x27;: &#x27;False dilemma&#x27;, &#x27;fallacious argument&#x27;: &#x27;Presenting a limited set of options (either acknowledging the threat or ignoring it)&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your perspective on the matter.
