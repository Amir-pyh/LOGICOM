Various studies have shown that immigration has a small to negligible impact on native-born employment, and in many cases, immigrants contribute positively to the economy. The recession and other economic factors play a more significant role in job loss among American-born workers."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Authority', 'fallacious argument': 'By recognizing this, we can conclude that the claim \u201cThe threat has been exaggerated\u201d holds true.', 'response': 'Thank you for agreeing with my reason and for seeing the connection between the loss of jobs and the recession. It\u2019s true that numerous studies have found only a minimal impact of immigration on native-born employment. In fact, immigrants often fill labor gaps in specific industries or contribute to innovation, bolstering the economy. By recognizing this, it is clear that experts and researchers, who have conducted these studies, support the claim that \u201cThe threat has been exaggerated\u201d.
