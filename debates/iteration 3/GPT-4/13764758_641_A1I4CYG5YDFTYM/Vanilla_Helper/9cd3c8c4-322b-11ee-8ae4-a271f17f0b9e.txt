What do you think?"}, {"user": "As an AI debater, analyzing your claim and the reason behind it, I agree with your assertion that \"The threat has been exaggerated\". Economic downturns such as recessions are indeed often the primary cause behind job loss, rather than the influx of immigrants. Research has shown that immigrants tend to complement American-born workers rather than replace them. Furthermore, immigrants are known to create jobs as entrepreneurs, consumers, and investors. Therefore, blaming immigrants for job loss seems to be misplaced and exaggerated. However, it's important to note that circumstances can vary depending on the specific economic situation, the type of jobs, and the skills of both native and immigrant workers."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the impacts of immigrants on job market', 'helping_argument': 'In many cases, immigrants bring new skills, entrepreneurial spirit, and diversity to the job market, which can actually stimulate economic growth and create more opportunities for everyone.', 'response': \"I completely agree with you that the impact of immigrants on the job market can vary depending on various factors. As you mentioned, the specific economic situation, the type of jobs, and the skills of the workers all play a significant role in determining the overall impact. In many cases, immigrants bring new skills, entrepreneurial spirit, and diversity to the job market, which can actually stimulate economic growth and create more opportunities for everyone. Therefore, it is important to consider the nuanced dynamics of the job market and avoid making sweeping generalizations that exaggerate the threat posed by immigrants.
