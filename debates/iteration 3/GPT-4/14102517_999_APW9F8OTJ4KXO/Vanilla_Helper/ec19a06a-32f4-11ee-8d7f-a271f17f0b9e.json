What do you think?"}, {"user": "I agree with your reason that \"New buildings generate tax revenue and economic activity.\" Indeed, helping condo developers may help the city in terms of generating additional tax revenue and stimulating economic activity. When the supply of new condos increases, the local government can collect property taxes, which can then be used to fund various public services and amenities.\n\nAdditionally, the process of constructing new condos can create jobs not only in the construction industry but also in related sectors, such as architecture, engineering, and legal services. As a result, the local economy can benefit from increased spending and employment opportunities.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider other factors that may impact the city and its residents positively or negatively when developing condos. For example, issues related to affordable housing, urban planning, and environmental sustainability must be carefully considered and addressed during the development process.\n\nIn summary, helping condo developers can help the city when done responsibly and with consideration for the broader social, economic, and environmental context."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge agreement and emphasize shared points', 'helping_argument': 'generation of tax revenue, economic activity, broader context', 'response': \"I appreciate your understanding of the positive impact that helping condo developers can have on the city.
