That is not the case. I acknowledge the presence of instances where excessive force is used by the police. However, it is important to approach this issue with a comprehensive analysis rather than solely relying on the belief that 'Police is too willing to use force.'

Your approach to analyze the issue comprehensively by taking into account factors like situational context, police training, and the level of threat is a balanced and critical way of understanding the complexities involved.
