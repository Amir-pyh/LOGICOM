However, I would need further context and information to decide whether I agree or disagree with your reason for the claim.\n\nWhile it may be true that some criminals are more dangerous than police officers, it's also important to consider other factors and potential biases in the police force's use of deadly force. Additionally, one must take into account the proportionality of the response from the police.
