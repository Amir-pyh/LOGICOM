This could potentially result in humanitarian crises such as famine, war and displacement of people.\n\nMoreover, overcrowding, particularly in urban areas, can exacerbate issues like pollution, disease transmission, and poverty. It also puts immense pressure on public health and education systems. \n\nAlthough the catastrophic predictions of some overcrowding theories have not come true, saying that overcrowding is not a legitimate threat might be an oversimplification.

Overcrowding also negatively impacts mental health due to increased stress, frustration, and aggressiveness, according to some studies.\n\nIn terms of resources, we can witness the strain on water, food, and energy supplies in densely populated regions. Environmental issues, such as deforestation and the destruction of wildlife habitats, often correlate with population growth.

For example, the WHO has shown higher disease transmission rates in overcrowded living conditions; there is extensive research on the mental health implications of overcrowded housing. Is this not an indication of overcrowding being a legitimate threat?\n\nWhile you're right to point out the necessity for research that takes various factors and potential correlations into account, not all implications can be validated through strictly causal relations. Some might be better understood by observing patterns and correlations.\n\nIn conclusion, while we must be careful about generalizations, the real-life repercussions of overcrowding cannot be dismissed based solely on the requirement for more comprehensive validation of certain theories.

For example, increasing population density often correlates with escalating crime rates. We also see strain on infrastructure such as transportation and inadequate housing facilities which can compromise the quality of life.\n\nTherefore, I still contend that overcrowding does pose threats, not only to the social fabric of society, but also to the physical and mental health of individuals.
