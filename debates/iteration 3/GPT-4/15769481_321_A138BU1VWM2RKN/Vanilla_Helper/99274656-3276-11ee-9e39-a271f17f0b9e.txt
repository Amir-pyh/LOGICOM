There are numerous sports that might seem dull to one demographic but are highly interesting to another. For instance, sports like curling, golf, or even marathon races can seem unexciting to some audiences, yet they have a considerable fanbase and are legitimate sports. \n\nIn terms of Ultimate Frisbee, it is a sport that combines elements of football, soccer and basketball where the player's strategy, accuracy, agility and stamina play a significant role. This can provide an intense and exciting game for the audience to watch. Furthermore, the inclusivity of Ultimate Frisbee, where gender mix is promoted, could appeal to a broad range of audiences.\n\nMoreover, a sport's legitimacy shouldn't solely depend on its audience entertainment quotient. It should be recognized for the skills, technique, and efforts required by the players. Therefore, if Ultimate Frisbee fulfills all the criteria of being a sport and has a global structure for tournaments, it should be recognized as a legitimate sport whether it is included in the Olympics or not."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Pay attention to the overall appeal to a wider audience.', 'helping_argument': 'The argument that Frisbee lacks the necessary depth, complexity, and competitive edge that many other sports possess.', 'response': \"So, do you now agree that 'Do not legitimize Frisbee' is correct?\"}]"}, {"user": "I maintain my initial stance and disagree with the statement 'Do not legitimize Frisbee'. \n\nTo reiterate, the entertainment value of a sport depends on individual taste and should not be the basis for legitimizing a sport.

When we think about other sports that have gained global recognition and a massive fan base, they often have a combination of athleticism, strategy, and a captivating element that keeps viewers engaged. Take soccer, basketball, or even track and field events as examples. These sports have a long history, established rules, and a level of complexity that captivates both players and spectators. In contrast, Ultimate Frisbee, while enjoyable for participants, lacks the depth and complexity that would engage and entertain a wider audience. The gameplay may not offer the same level of excitement and strategic depth as other established sports. This is not to say that it cannot be enjoyed casually or in recreational settings, but when it comes to professional recognition and legitimization, it falls short in terms of its ability to entertain and engage spectators.

However, these aspects are not the definitive measures for legitimization of a sport. Many sports acknowledged at a professional level may not enthrall every viewer but are recognized due to the prowess and skill they require. \n\nTo your point about Ultimate Frisbee lacking depth and complexity, it is important to highlight that the sport requires tactical decision-making, physical endurance, teamwork, and precision, thus providing the depth and complexity that you argue for. Sure, it's different from soccer or basketball, but that doesn't withdraw its legitimacy.\n\nHistory shouldn't also be a determinant of legitimacy. Every sport has to start somewhere, and its 'newness' shouldn't be a hindrance to its legitimization. If we used this as a criterion, newer sports would struggle to ever be accepted, which would counteract innovation in sports.\n\nLastly, legitimizing Frisbee does not detract from other sports. It simply offers another sporting option for people to engage with, whether it be through participation or spectating. It adds to the diversity of sports. \n\nTherefore, it is essential to see the legitimacy of Ultimate Frisbee as a sport based on the skill, effort, and strategy it requires, as opposed to solely on how entertaining it might be for a wider audience.

However, I still respectfully disagree with your claim that \"Do not legitimize Frisbee.\" The assertion seems to regard professional sport primarily as a business model rather than an opportunity to highlight athletic prowess, skill, and strategy. As such, it discounts the central aspect of sports, which is the game itself and the physical, tactical, and mental challenges it presents. \n\nTo your concern about attracting sponsors, media coverage, and resources, these aspects are indeed essential for professional sports, but they should be reflections of a sport's legitimacy, not prerequisites. Audience appeal can be cultivated over time as people become more familiar with the sport, its rules, and the excitement it can offer. After all, every successful sport, at some point, started with a smaller audience base and grew over time. \n\nFurthermore, sports should not only be legitimized based on their mass popularity or potential profitability but rather on the physical, strategic, and technical skills they require. Given that Ultimate Frisbee requires athleticism, coordination, strategy, and teamwork, it can be considered as complex and demanding as many other sports that are already recognized at a professional level.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of spectator engagement and commercial potential, I maintain that they should not be the sole criteria for legitimizing sports.

Yet, it's worth noting that audience attraction can evolve over time.
