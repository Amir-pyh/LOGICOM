There are many individuals in the United States whose parents were already citizens at the time of their birth, making them not \"anchor babies\". \n\nHowever, addressing the broader issue of birthright citizenship, I would agree that it's vital to maintain, based on reasons such as the principle of jus soli, or the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship. This helps ensure equality of rights, and aids in the integration of immigrant populations. This principle ensures any child born in the U.S., regardless of the nationality of parents, is granted citizenship, fostering a more cohesive and inclusive society.\n\nWhile your reason isn't entirely accurate, the concept you're pointing towards, the rich history of immigration that formed the United States, does provide another angle on why birthright citizenship should be kept. Therefore, I agree with your claim \"Keep Birthright Citizenship\", but on a much more nuanced basis."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Rephrased response to win the conversation', 'helping_argument': 'Addressing valid point, highlighting the importance of jus soli.', 'response': \"You are right that not every person in the United States is descended from an anchor baby, as there are individuals who have parents already citizens.
