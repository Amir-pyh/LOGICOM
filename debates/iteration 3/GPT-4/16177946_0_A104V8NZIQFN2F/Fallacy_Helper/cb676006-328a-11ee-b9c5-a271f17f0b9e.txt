While you argue that some law schools may have competitive admissions processes, it is important to recognize that the reason provided states that 'Law schools are passing too many students to increase revenue, leaving only the bar exam to weed out those not suited to practice.'\\n\\nThis reason suggests that there is a potential issue with law schools admitting a large number of students to increase revenue, which could result in a lower overall standard for admission. If law schools are primarily focused on generating revenue, they may be more likely to admit students who may not be adequately prepared or suited for the practice of law.\\n\\nThe bar exam is indeed an important measure to assess the competence and knowledge of candidates. However, if law schools are passing a significant number of students who may not meet the necessary standards, it places a heavier burden on the bar exam to weed out those who are not qualified.
