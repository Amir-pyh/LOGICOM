Your reason for claiming that &quot;the bar is not too low to get into law school&quot; is based on a specific circumstance.

We should look at the educational requirements, workload, and commitment necessary for entering law school, as well as the ultimate goal of producing skilled legal professionals. Only then will we be able to accurately determine whether the bar is set too low or not.

That being said, your personal experience does highlight the importance of accessibility and opportunities for non-traditional students.

In determining whether &quot;the bar is not too low to get into law school,&quot; we should look at various factors such as prerequisite educational standards, admission criteria, performance expectations during law school, and bar exam success rates. 

We also need to examine the purpose and goals of law schools, which are to produce highly skilled and competent legal professionals that can navigate the complex legal environment. In addition to that, we should consider the diversity and accessibility of law schools and the opportunities they provide to different students, including non-traditional students, like those attending night school. 

By evaluating these factors and understanding the larger context, we can more effectively determine if the bar is set appropriately for law school admission or if changes are necessary to ensure the overall quality of legal education and the preparedness of graduates entering the legal field.

Moreover, it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that the standard for law school admissions may differ depending on factors such as location, institution, and evolving legal environments. Therefore, it is essential to continually revisit and re-evaluate the bar to ensure it remains relevant and effective in preparing future attorneys for their roles in society.
