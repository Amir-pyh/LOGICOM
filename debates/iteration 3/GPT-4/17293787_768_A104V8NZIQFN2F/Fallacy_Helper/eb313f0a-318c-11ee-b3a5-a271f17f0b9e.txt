However, when we analyze the way Iran conducts itself, we can see signs of weakness. For example, Iran has faced significant economic challenges due to international sanctions, and its military capabilities are inferior to many other countries in the region. Additionally, Iran has engaged in negotiations and international agreements, such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which aimed to limit its nuclear program. These actions suggest a willingness to cooperate and abide by international norms.
