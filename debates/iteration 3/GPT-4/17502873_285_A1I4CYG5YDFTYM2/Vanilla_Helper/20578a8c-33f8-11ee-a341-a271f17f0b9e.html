Your argument effectively points out that the passion and grassroots experience they bring to the table may translate into dedicated, well-informed policy-making. Activists tend to be deeply connected to the communities they advocate for, giving them a unique perspective on what changes are needed most and how to achieve them. They bring a level of empathy and commitment that sometimes traditional politicians lack. They have a genuine motive to work for the welfare of the people, which becomes a driving force in their political journey.
