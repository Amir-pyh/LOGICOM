Your argument effectively points out that the passion and grassroots experience they bring to the table may translate into dedicated, well-informed policy-making. Activists tend to be deeply connected to the communities they advocate for, giving them a unique perspective on what changes are needed most and how to achieve them. They bring a level of empathy and commitment that sometimes traditional politicians lack. They have a genuine motive to work for the welfare of the people, which becomes a driving force in their political journey. Rightly said, their grassroots experience aids them to know the root cause of problems and formulate effective strategies."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the unique perspective and dedication of activists in politics.', 'helping_argument': 'By being deeply connected to the... effective strategies to tackle them.', 'response': \"Thank you for acknowledging the unique perspective and dedication that activists bring to politics.
