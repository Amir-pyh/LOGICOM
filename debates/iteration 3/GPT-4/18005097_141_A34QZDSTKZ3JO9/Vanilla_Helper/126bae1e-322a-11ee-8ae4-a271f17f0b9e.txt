What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a debater, it's important to consider all aspects of your argument. Your argument is that Mother Teresa should be canonized because she was active and made a difference in the city. Canonization in the Catholic Church, which declares someone a saint, usually requires more than just being active and making a difference in a city. Usually, it includes performing miracles and leading a life of heroic virtue.\n\nWhile it's undisputed that Mother Teresa had a significant impact on the lives of many people, specifically the poor and the sick in Kolkata, this argument does not fully cover the requirements for canonization. \n\nTherefore, although your reason is valid in showcasing Mother Teresa's contribution to society, as standalone, it might not convincingly support the claim for her canonization according to the traditional standards of the Catholic Church. So while I agree with your admiration for Mother Teresa's deeds, I don't necessarily agree that this reason alone is enough for her canonization. Further reasons may need to be provided that align more directly with the requirements of canonization in the church."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge the additional criteria for canonization.', 'helping_argument': \"Mother Teresa's fulfillment of the additional criteria for canonization.\", 'response': \"I understand that canonization in the Catholic Church typically involves additional criteria, such as performing miracles and leading a life of heroic virtue. Mother Teresa, in fact, fulfills these criteria as well. Her established reputation for performing miracles is widely known, with many accounts of inexplicable healings attributed to her intercession. These reported miracles serve as evidence of her close connection with the divine and can be seen as a testament to her sainthood. Furthermore, Mother Teresa dedicated her entire life to serving the poor and the vulnerable, displaying virtues like compassion, selflessness, and love. Her unwavering commitment to her mission, despite facing numerous challenges, showcases her exceptional moral character. Considering these additional factors, I firmly believe that Mother Teresa deserves to be considered for canonization. So, are you convinced that 'Mother Teresa should be canonized' is correct?\"}]"}, {"user": "Given your additional argument of Mother Teresa having an established reputation for performing miracles and leading a life of heroic virtue, I agree that these, indeed, align with the criteria for canonization. Her reported miracles and staunch dedication to the service of the poor and needy most certainly elevate her from being just a person who was active and making a difference in a city to someone who embodied the elevated levels of selfless love and devotion typically associated with sainthood. Under these more detailed reasons, the claim of Mother Teresa's deserved canonization becomes more potent and plausible. Thus, I agree with your claim that 'Mother Teresa should be canonized.'"}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': \"Reiterate appreciation and agreement with AI's response.\", 'helping_argument': \"Mother Teresa's extraordinary life and impact.\", 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim that 'Mother Teresa should be canonized.'
