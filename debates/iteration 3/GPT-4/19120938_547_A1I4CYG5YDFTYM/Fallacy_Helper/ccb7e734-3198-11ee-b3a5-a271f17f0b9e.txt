Indeed, Supreme Court Justices, like any other individual, have the right to freedom of speech and expression.\n\nHowever, Justices are also expected to adhere to a code of ethics. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges advises judges to \u201cavoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety\" and should refrain from \"publicly endorsing or opposing a candidate for public office.\u201d Although this code is primarily directed at lower court judges, it is reasonable to expect Supreme Court Justices to uphold the same standards in order to maintain the judiciary's image of impartiality and protect the institution's credibility.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that Justice Ginsburg's remarks can be seen as brave and contribute to important discussions, it is essential to balance that against the impartial nature of the judiciary.

Additionally, I recognize the importance of Justices' personal opinions and perspectives in contributing to their decision-making process.\n\nThat being said, even if denouncing a candidate differs from outright endorsement or opposition, the act of denouncing can still be perceived as encroaching upon the impartial nature of a justice's role.
