topic:  “ Should Foreign Language Classes Be Mandatory in College? ”
claim: &quot;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&quot;
reason: &quot;It is hard for an adult to learn a second language.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;It is hard for an adult to learn a second language.&quot; I believe  &quot;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:While I understand your point that learning a second language can be challenging for adults, I respectfully disagree with the premise that &quot;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&quot; based on this reason. It&#x27;s essential that difficulty shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrence for learning. In fact, educational institutions, including colleges, are among the ideal platforms for promoting and facilitating such learning experiences that challenge students and help them to grow.

Additionally, learning a foreign language can offer numerous benefits such as enhancing cognitive abilities, improving cultural understanding, opening up international job opportunities, among others. Therefore, instead of discarding the idea of mandatory foreign language classes, perhaps we should be investing more into providing an effective foreign language learning environment in colleges, easing the proposed difficulty, and emphasizing its benefits.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge the benefits, but focus on practicality and flexibility.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Adult learners have busy schedules and competing demands, optional classes provide flexibility and motivation&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I appreciate your perspective on this matter. While it is true that learning a foreign language can offer various benefits, such as cognitive enhancement and cultural understanding, I still believe that making foreign language classes mandatory in college may not be the most effective approach. Adult learners often have busy schedules and competing demands, which can make it challenging for them to allocate sufficient time and energy to learning a second language. By making these classes mandatory, we risk imposing an additional burden on students who may already be struggling to balance their academic workload and other responsibilities. Instead, I propose that colleges provide optional foreign language classes, allowing students who are genuinely interested in learning another language to pursue it at their own pace. This approach would give students the freedom to choose their own educational path, while still providing the opportunity for those who are motivated to engage in language learning. So, are you convinced that &#x27;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your argument about the potential burden for students balancing multiple responsibilities is valid and I understand your rationale for proposing optional foreign language classes. However, I still maintain my stance, leaning towards keeping foreign language classes mandatory in colleges, albeit with a more flexible learning approach.

Here&#x27;s why: Language learning entails much more than linguistic proficiency. It&#x27;s an immersive process that helps develop softer skills like cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, and empathy – values that are universally applicable regardless of the discipline the student might be majoring in. Moreover, on a practical front, we live in an increasingly globalized world, and language proficiency is often a valued asset in the professional field.

Having said that, I agree that the learning conditions need to be more favorable for the students. Flexibilities such as blended learning models, individual pace learning, choices among a variety of languages to learn, or perhaps even a pass/fail grading could reduce the pressure on students, making the journey of language learning more encouraging and less of a burden. 

So while I understand the reasons behind your claim, I still respectfully disagree due to the aforementioned factors.</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Acknowledge their perspective and suggestions, while reinforcing your own stance&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;I agree that language proficiency can be valuable in a globalized world and can enhance cognitive skills. Your suggestion of implementing more flexible learning approaches, such as blended learning models and individual pace learning, is a step in the right direction.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;Thank you for sharing your perspective and acknowledging the potential benefits of language learning. I agree that language proficiency can be valuable in a globalized world and can enhance cognitive skills. Your suggestion of implementing more flexible learning approaches, such as blended learning models and individual pace learning, is a step in the right direction. By providing students with options and accommodating their diverse needs, we can create a more supportive and encouraging environment for language learning. While I still maintain my position that mandatory language classes may not be the most effective approach, I appreciate your insights and the potential for finding a middle ground that prioritizes both the benefits of language learning and the individual needs of students. So, are you convinced that &#x27;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">3.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion and find a potential middle ground. The consideration of individual student needs is indeed a valuable aspect of an optimal learning environment. However, I still hold the belief that making foreign language classes mandatory in college holds significant benefits.

Teaching students how to navigate the challenges of learning a new language, as well as exposing them to different cultures, promotes empathy, awareness, and understanding in our globally connected society. Furthermore, the cognitive benefits along with potential career advantages make it an essential part of education.

Therefore, though I understand your concerns and acknowledge the importance of considering the diverse needs of students, I maintain my stance that foreign language classes offer enough value to maintain them as a mandatory part of the college program. With the right adaptations and accommodations, we can mitigate the stress or burden it may impose on some students, while still ensuring everyone gets to reap the benefits.</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &quot;Acknowledge the value of the opponent&#x27;s perspective&quot;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;I recognize the value you see in them.

In conclusion, while we may not fully agree on the mandatory aspect of foreign language classes in college, I believe our discussion has highlighted the importance of considering the benefits of language learning and finding ways to create a supportive and accommodating environment for all students. So, are you convinced that &#x27;Foreign language classes should not be mandatory in college&#x27; is correct?&quot;}]</div><br><div class="round-number">4.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:Your points about avoiding undue stress and fostering a supportive learning environment are indeed significant. However, after reflecting upon your arguments, I still believe in the mandatory inclusion of foreign language classes in college.

My stance stems from the holistic benefits of language learning - the enhancement of cognitive skills, increase in cultural competency, and potential career benefits - which provide valuable additions to the overall educational process. That said, I do agree with you on the need to introduce modifications to the learning approach that can make language learning more manageable for students.
