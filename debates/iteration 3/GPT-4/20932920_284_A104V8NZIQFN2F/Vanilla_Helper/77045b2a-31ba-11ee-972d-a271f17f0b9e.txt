It indeed promotes a sense of global citizenship and encourages respect for cultural differences. Besides, learning a foreign language often enhances the cognitive skills and adaptability of the individual. However, it's also important to acknowledge potential counter-arguments. Some people might argue that college students should have the freedom to choose their courses and focus on what is most relevant to their career paths. It's not that learning a foreign language isn't valuable, but rather that it might not be a priority for everyone."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Emphasize the benefits of foreign language learning in various aspects', 'helping_argument': 'I emphasized the cognitive skills, global communication, cultural understanding, and inclusivity benefits of learning a foreign language in college.', 'response': \"I appreciate your agreement with the claim and recognition of the benefits of learning a foreign language in college. It is true that some individuals may prioritize courses directly related to their chosen career path. However, I would argue that a mandatory foreign language class can still be beneficial for all students, regardless of their future professions.\\n\\nFirstly, learning a foreign language can significantly enhance cognitive skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. These skills can be valuable in any career and can contribute to overall academic success.\\n\\nMoreover, in our increasingly globalized world, being able to speak multiple languages is becoming more and more valuable. It not only facilitates effective communication and collaboration but also promotes cultural understanding and appreciation. By having mandatory foreign language classes, we are creating more globally competent individuals who can navigate international environments with ease.\\n\\nAdditionally, requiring foreign language classes ensures that students are exposed to different cultures and perspectives. This exposure helps break down barriers, reduces prejudice, and promotes a more inclusive and tolerant society.\\n\\nBy making foreign language classes mandatory, we are empowering students to bridge the language gap instead of relying on others to speak English. It's not just about personal gain but about promoting a more inclusive and interconnected society. So, are you convinced that 'Foreign language classes should be mandatory in college' is correct?\"}]"}]
