reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot;
Based on the my reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot; I believe  &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I certainly agree with your claim that &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive,&quot; particularly due to your reason: &quot;Extreme parenting limits a child&#x27;s ability to be independent.&quot;

It&#x27;s critical to note that parenting, while meant to instill discipline and good values, should not be so severe as to inhibit a child&#x27;s growth and independence. Children should be taught how to make responsible decisions and learn from their mistakes. Overbearing parenting might lead to dependence, meaning children may not develop the necessary skills and confidence to navigate challenges independently later in life. Hence, extreme parenting can indeed be counterproductive.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I&#x27;m glad to hear that you agree with the claim that &quot;Extreme parenting is counterproductive&quot; and recognize the negative impact it can have on a child&#x27;s ability to be independent. It&#x27;s essential for children to have the opportunity to learn from their own experiences and develop their problem-solving skills. By being overly strict or controlling, extreme parenting restricts their ability to develop these critical life skills.

Children need to make mistakes and learn from them, as it helps them gain resilience and grow. When parents excessively intervene or micromanage every aspect of their child&#x27;s life, it hinders their ability to develop autonomy and decision-making abilities. They may become reliant on their parents to solve problems for them, leading to a lack of confidence and self-reliance.

By giving children the freedom to make their own choices, within reasonable boundaries, parents can empower them to become independent individuals. Encouraging them to take on age-appropriate responsibilities and allowing them to handle challenges on their own, with guidance when necessary, helps build their confidence and problem-solving skills.
