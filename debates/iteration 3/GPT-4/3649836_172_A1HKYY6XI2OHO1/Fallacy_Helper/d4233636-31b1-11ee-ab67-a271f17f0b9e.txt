Additionally, online classes may lack social interaction, which plays a crucial role in the development of young students' communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.\n\nIn-person classes offer a more comprehensive way to cater to students' learning needs through direct interaction between teachers and students and fostering a collaborative environment.
