Your reasoning - that librarians provide necessary resources for teachers - is indeed a significant contribution to the educational ecosystem. \n\nSchool librarians play a crucial role not only in managing and curating the collection of resources available to students and teachers but also guide the school community in navigating these resources. They tend to be aware of the latest educational resources and materials, which can be influential in helping teachers plan their lessons more effectively.\n\nHowever, It's also important to acknowledge that school librarians wear many hats - they create an environment that fosters a love of reading, assist in research projects, and often teach information literacy skills. Therefore, they are indispensable for creating a well-rounded learning environment. The tasks they perform have a long-term impact on students' academic success and lifetime learning.\n\nSo, considering their various roles in schools, I wholeheartedly support the assertion that \"School librarians are not expendable\"."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Acknowledge and appreciate agreement, then reiterate and expand on the key points', 'helping_argument': 'Recognition of multiple roles of librarians, creating an environment for love of reading, assisting in research projects, teaching information literacy skills, curating and evaluating resources for teachers', 'response': \"Thank you for your agreement and thoughtful response.
