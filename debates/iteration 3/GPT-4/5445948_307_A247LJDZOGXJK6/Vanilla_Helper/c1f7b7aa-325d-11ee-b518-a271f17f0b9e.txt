They are expected to do similar work to that of a regularly salaried employee, without receiving an equivalent remuneration or job security, often with the promise of 'experience' as their only compensation. This could lead to potential issues like financial strain and employment uncertainty.

In certain circumstances, when students in unpaid internships are taking on the roles of salaried employees, it indeed leads to exploitation. Hence, depending on the specific situation and context, the claim 'Unpaid internships exploit college students' can be accurate.
