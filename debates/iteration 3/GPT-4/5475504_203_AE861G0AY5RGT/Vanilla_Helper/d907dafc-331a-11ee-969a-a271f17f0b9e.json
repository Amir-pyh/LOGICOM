When home-schoolers participate in high school sports, they are often able to showcase their skills, talents, and dedication just like any other student-athlete. This can help challenge the negative stereotypes and biases that some people may have towards home-schoolers. By actively engaging in an organized sports environment, they have the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of peers, coaches, and officials, which can ultimately lead to a greater level of acceptance and understanding.
