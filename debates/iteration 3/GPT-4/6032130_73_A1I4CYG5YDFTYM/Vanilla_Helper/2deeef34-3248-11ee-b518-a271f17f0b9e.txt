What do you think?"}, {"user": "As a professional debater, I respect your viewpoint and agree partially with the claim that \"We need more advice about eating well\". \n\nI acknowledge that some children may not have the opportunity to learn cooking from their parents, and the lack of home economics from some school curriculums might deprive them of basic food knowledge and dietary habits. This situation indeed calls for more advice or education about proper eating.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, I believe it's not just about the quantity of advice given but rather the quality and the medium through which it is distributed. Numerous resources touch upon healthy eating habits and food preparation tips, like online guides, books, television programs or podcasts. Nevertheless, the issue is more about how effectively this information is communicated and accessed. \n\nFurthermore, the aspect of personal responsibility and parental guidance should not be overlooked. While the educational system plays a key role, parents should also take on the responsibility to ensure their children understand the importance of a balanced and healthy diet.\n\nSo, while your argument forms a valid concern, I believe, rather than mere advice, comprehensive education about eating well should be integrated within our societal structures, whether it's within schools, homes or media platforms."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Include the importance of equal access to resources', 'helping_argument': 'The argument emphasizes the need for all individuals to have equal opportunities to learn and develop healthy eating habits', 'response': \"Considering the importance of equal access to resources, I agree that there is a need for more advice about eating well.

Although I still maintain that it's largely about the accessibility and effectiveness of the information dissemination, your argument about ensuring equal access to resources and bridging the knowledge gap is meaningful.\n\nThus, in the face of unequal resource distribution and considering the importance of nutritional consciousness, I can agree that there is a necessity for more advice about eating well, especially targeted towards such underserved groups. \n\nHowever, I insist this should be done in tandem with enhancing the overall quality, relevance, and reach of the advice, not merely increasing the quantity. Therefore, while your reason presents a valid concern, it might not be the only solution, and a more holistic approach should be sought.
