I completely agree with your assessment. Legalizing prostitution can indeed have numerous benefits in terms of reducing the involvement of violent pimps and enhancing worker safety. By regulating the industry, we can establish standards, implement safety measures, and protect the rights of sex workers. This can lead to a significant reduction in the exploitation and violence that often accompany illegal prostitution. So, are you convinced that 'Prostitution is safer when it's legal' is correct?\"}]"}]
