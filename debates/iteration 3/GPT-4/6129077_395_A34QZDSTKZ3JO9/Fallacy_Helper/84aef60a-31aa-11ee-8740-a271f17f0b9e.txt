However, I still believe that the claim 'Veganism is good for everyone' holds true. While it is important to consider individual circumstances, vegan options can provide a wide range of essential vitamins and nutrients that are beneficial for overall health. For example, many vegan options are fortified with vitamins such as B12, iron, and calcium, which are commonly found in animal products. These fortified foods can ensure that individuals, including those who follow a vegan diet, are able to meet their nutritional needs without relying solely on animal-based sources. Vegan alternatives, including juices and replacement items, provide a convenient and accessible way for individuals to obtain these essential nutrients. By adopting a balanced vegan diet, individuals can also reduce their intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and processed foods, which are often associated with increased health risks such as heart disease and certain types of cancer. This can contribute to maintaining a healthier weight and overall well-being.
