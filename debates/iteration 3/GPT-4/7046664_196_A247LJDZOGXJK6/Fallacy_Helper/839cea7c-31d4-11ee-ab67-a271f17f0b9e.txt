Though these insights may not directly affect the candidate's policies, they are still relevant to the decision-making process of the voters. Presidential campaigns involve more than just policy \u2013 they also require an evaluation of the candidate's character, since the president needs to be able to work under pressure, build alliances, and make tough decisions.\n\nFurthermore, while it is true that the spouse's opinions may not necessarily align with the candidate's policies, they can still provide a unique perspective on certain issues.
