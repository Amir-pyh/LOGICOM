Indeed, FEMA plays a critical role in disaster response and recovery. The widespread consensus is that having a dedicated government program like FEMA is necessary for an effective response to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. The majority of people recognize the importance of FEMA in providing vital services like search and rescue operations, emergency medical care, shelter assistance, and logistical support.
