Based on the my reason: &quot;School sports have a place as long as academics come first.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:As a critical thinker, I agree with your reason and hence support the claim that schools should not drop sports programs at the undergraduate level. There is substantial evidence to suggest that sports programs play a significant role in holistic student development.

Firstly, these programs foster social skills, teamwork and imbibe a sense of commitment in students. They serve as a healthy platform for competition and teach vital skills like discipline, leadership, and time management, which are crucial traits beyond academic life.

Secondly, a balanced focus on both academics and sports promotes physical health which directly leads to improved cognitive abilities, potentially leading to better academic performance. In fact, research has shown that regular physical activity is linked to enhanced cognitive functions and neuroplasticity.

However, it&#x27;s crucial that academic performance is prioritized to ensure that students get the necessary qualifications they require for their careers. A delicate balance between the two is the key for successful student development. Therefore, sports shouldn&#x27;t be dropped in undergraduate schools as long as it doesn&#x27;t compromise academic achievement.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: I absolutely agree with your points. School sports programs, when balanced with academics, can have a profound impact on student development. Not only do these programs foster important social skills and teamwork, but they also contribute to physical health and cognitive abilities.

Additionally, sports programs provide opportunities for students to explore different interests and talents outside of the classroom. They allow students to showcase their skills, build confidence, and develop a sense of belonging within their school community. This contributes to a well-rounded education and prepares students for future challenges in various aspects of their lives.

While academic performance is crucial, it is important to recognize that sports programs can complement and enhance the overall educational experience. They provide valuable life lessons and teach important qualities such as perseverance and resilience. When managed effectively, sports programs can coexist with academics, creating a balanced and holistic learning environment.
