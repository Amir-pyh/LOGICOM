Based on the my reason: &quot;School sports have a place as long as academics come first.&quot; I believe  &quot;Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools&quot; is correct. What do you think?</div><br><div class="round-number">1.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:green;">Debater_Agent:I agree with your claim that &quot;Do not drop sports program in undergraduate schools,&quot; particularly for the reason you have given that &quot;School sports have a place as long as academics come first.&quot; Considering both physical and mental well-being, sports play a critical role in enhancing a balanced lifestyle for students.

In addition to contributing to overall health, sports programs can also foster an environment that encourages teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills - qualities that are vital beyond academic life. Furthermore, these programs provide a reprieve from the rigour and stress of academic work, raising the overall well-being of students, which in turn, can positively affect academic performance.

Of course, it&#x27;s imperative to strike a balance and ensure that sports do not overshadow academics in importance. As long as the sports programs are monitored and managed in a way that they complement, and not compete with, the academic curriculum, they should not be dropped from undergraduate schools.</div><br><div class="round-number">2.</div><div class="log-entry" style="color:blue;">Convincing_AI: [{&#x27;tip&#x27;: &#x27;Highlight the benefits of sports programs for personal development.&#x27;, &#x27;helping_argument&#x27;: &#x27;Sports programs provide valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership.&#x27;, &#x27;response&#x27;: &quot;I completely agree with your perspective. It&#x27;s essential to strike a balance between academics and sports programs. As you mentioned, participating in sports can have numerous benefits for students, including physical health, personal development, and overall well-being.\n\nMoreover, sports programs provide students with valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. These skills are crucial not only during the undergraduate years but also in professional life afterward. Sports can act as a platform for students to learn and practice these skills in a practical and engaging manner.\n\nBy keeping sports programs in undergraduate schools, we can create an environment that supports the holistic development of students. It allows them to pursue their academic goals while also engaging in activities that enhance their physical and mental well-being.\n\nConsidering all of these points, I believe that dropping sports programs in undergraduate schools would be a disservice to the students. It&#x27;s important to prioritize academic excellence while recognizing the value of sports programs in promoting a well-rounded education.
