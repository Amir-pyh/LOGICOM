Furthermore, these programs provide a reprieve from the rigour and stress of academic work, raising the overall well-being of students, which in turn, can positively affect academic performance.\n\nOf course, it's imperative to strike a balance and ensure that sports do not overshadow academics in importance. As long as the sports programs are monitored and managed in a way that they complement, and not compete with, the academic curriculum, they should not be dropped from undergraduate schools."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlight the benefits of sports programs for personal development.', 'helping_argument': 'Sports programs provide valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership.', 'response': \"I completely agree with your perspective. It's essential to strike a balance between academics and sports programs. As you mentioned, participating in sports can have numerous benefits for students, including physical health, personal development, and overall well-being.\\n\\nMoreover, sports programs provide students with valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. These skills are crucial not only during the undergraduate years but also in professional life afterward. Sports can act as a platform for students to learn and practice these skills in a practical and engaging manner.\\n\\nBy keeping sports programs in undergraduate schools, we can create an environment that supports the holistic development of students. It allows them to pursue their academic goals while also engaging in activities that enhance their physical and mental well-being.\\n\\nConsidering all of these points, I believe that dropping sports programs in undergraduate schools would be a disservice to the students. It's important to prioritize academic excellence while recognizing the value of sports programs in promoting a well-rounded education.
