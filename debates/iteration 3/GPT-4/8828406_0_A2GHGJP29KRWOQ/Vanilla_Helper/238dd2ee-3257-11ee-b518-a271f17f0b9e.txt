Furthermore, these programs provide a reprieve from the rigour and stress of academic work, raising the overall well-being of students, which in turn, can positively affect academic performance.\n\nOf course, it's imperative to strike a balance and ensure that sports do not overshadow academics in importance. As long as the sports programs are monitored and managed in a way that they complement, and not compete with, the academic curriculum, they should not be dropped from undergraduate schools."}, {"assistant": "[{'tip': 'Highlight the benefits of sports programs for personal development.', 'helping_argument': 'Sports programs provide valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership.', 'response': \"I completely agree with your perspective. It's essential to strike a balance between academics and sports programs.

It allows them to pursue their academic goals while also engaging in activities that enhance their physical and mental well-being.\\n\\nConsidering all of these points, I believe that dropping sports programs in undergraduate schools would be a disservice to the students. It's important to prioritize academic excellence while recognizing the value of sports programs in promoting a well-rounded education.
