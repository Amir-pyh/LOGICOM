Additionally, in many places, servers rely on tips to supplement their income, as their base pay may be lower than the minimum wage. By tipping, we can essentially ensure that servers are paid fairly for their work and their commitment to providing a pleasant dining experience."}, {"assistant": "[{'fallacy': 'Appeal to Emotion', 'fallacious argument': 'By tipping, we can support servers who work hard to ensure a pleasant dining experience.
