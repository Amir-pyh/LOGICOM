Just look at the statistics - a whopping 80% of college students prefer living on campus. Clearly, the majority knows best, and their preference should be the basis for making decisions. When such a large number of students choose to live on campus, it must mean that there are significant advantages to doing so. It's not just about convenience or proximity, but also about the unique environment that fosters academic and social growth. The close proximity to campus resources such as libraries, academic support services, and extracurricular activities greatly enhances the educational experience. Living on campus also encourages collaboration and facilitates study groups and academic discussions, which are not as feasible for off-campus students. Additionally, the community aspect of dorm living cannot be overlooked. By residing in the same area, students are more likely to form friendships and engage in social activities. Numerous studies have consistently shown that students who live on campus not only develop a strong support network but also have higher levels of engagement with the college community.
