The sense of community in dorms creates opportunities for students to interact with a diverse group of peers, fostering social connections and personal growth. This community can also provide a support system and a sense of belonging, especially for incoming freshmen who may be adjusting to college life. Additionally, living on campus can enhance academic success as students have easy access to campus resources, such as libraries, study groups, and academic advising.
